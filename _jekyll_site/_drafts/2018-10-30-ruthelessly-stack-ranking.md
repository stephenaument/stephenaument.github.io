# Ruthlessly Stack Ranking Your ~~People~~ Priorities

## Intro

The Long Dark is a challenging survival game from Hinterland Games that places you in remote northern Canada during winter with few resources.  One thing The Long Dark does that other games don’t tend to bother with is a realistic/ish inventory system. Every item has weight, and based on a variety of factors you can only carry a certain weight before it starts to affect your speed and stamina. It’s not a wooden literalism, but it has the “feel” of reality. I remember running around in the Half Life series with what would have been thousands of pounds of gear that would have filled a large truck, not to mention what you can fit in your Minecraft inventory. But not here.

This inventory system forces you to make hard choices about what to pick up and what to drop. Can I afford to pick up this log now? How much meat should I harvest from this deer carcass?

You are not always choosing between valuable items and junk. Sometimes you have to leave good items behind, and it hurts.

## The Concept

I’ve become associated around ReadyRosie with the concept of ruthlessly stack-ranking priorities.

What is stack ranking? Stack ranking is simply sorting a list of items 1-N.

Some other prioritization systems have you group tasks into buckets, A, B, C, etc. Stack ranking forces you to choose which of any 2 items is more important.

This is a _terrible_ idea when it comes to people (please don’t stack rank your employees!), but it works _brilliantly_  when it comes to prioritizing work.

## The Method

It’s really simple to do. But simple doesn’t mean easy. It can be brutally hard.

We are a small team at ReadyRosie. There will always be more than we can do. We are never choosing between adding deep value and adding fluff. Just like in The Long Dark, every day we have to choose between valuable options. Which good things are we not going to do this sprint so we can focus on these other things that have edged them out?

So, we stack rank them. We get all stakeholders together in a (virtual) room, often in real time, and hash it out. We’ve done it by sorting the list, one item at a time. We’ve done it by assigning numbers 0-100 and then sorting based on those numbers. Either way, the most important thing is that the top 5-10 items are what we have identified as the _most important_ things we could be doing, in _that order._ Then if we work from the top down, we can know that what we are doing is what we _should_ be doing, because it meets our definition of doing the most important thing we _could_ be doing.

It’s the same for individual projects or features. We’re learning to be iterative in our product development and optimize for learning in tight feedback loops by putting working software in our customers hands as quickly as we can. But sometimes somebody has been chewing on a project idea for a while. We have gifted subject matter experts who have been in the classroom and know our customers and their pains well. They are thoughtful. They listen. They are creative. Often, they have a pretty well developed idea of a complete solution to a problem. One that would take months to implement and be a huge gamble. Is that complete solution the right solution? Maybe. Can we afford months of development time before actually getting valuable feedback that tells us if it’s the right solution? Probably not.

I’ve led groups through the exercise of stack ranking the precious, well thought-out features of their solution and the conversation goes something like this:

INT. DAY - CONFERENCE ROOM.

A whiteboard fills one wall. STEP stands at the
whiteboard on either side of a dozen 3in Post-It
notes arranged on the board with notes written on
them. CHIP, subject matter expert, sits across
the room.


                    STEP

    Let's pretend we are going to start
    working on this this sprint and maybe
    we actually can.

    If we could do one thing this sprint.
    What’s the most important piece of this
    that would add value to our customers
    while also giving us the best feedback
    so we can learn the most? What would
    it be?


                    PO/SME

    One??? Can I have five things?


                    STEP

    We only have time for one.


                    PO/SME

    I guess it would be this one.


                    STEP

    Perfect. Oh, hey. I just found out
    we have room for one more.


                    PO/SME

    Then we should add this one.


                    STEP

    You know what? We have time for
    one more feature.


                    PO/SME

    Well, the next three really go
    together. I couldn't imagine
    separating them.


                    STEP

    There is room for three total,
    and I’m not sure we will ever do
    any more work on this project
    again after this sprint.


                    PO/SME

    I hate you, Step. But if I have
    to choose, it’s this one.

## So What?

In either scenario, you wind up with the most important things at the top of the list.

What “important” means in your context is an entirely different question, and learning to make those decisions is a skill to develop. But if you prioritize this way and actually work from the top of your list downward, then a lot of things just fall into place.

Did your day get away from you in the afternoon? Only get to work on one thing? That’s okay, because that one thing that you worked on was the most important thing. What else can you ask for?
