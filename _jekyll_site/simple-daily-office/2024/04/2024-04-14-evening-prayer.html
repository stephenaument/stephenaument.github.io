<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Nebuchadnezzar’s Second Dream</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: May you have abundant prosperity!  The signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked for me I am pleased to recount.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">How great are his signs,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>how mighty his wonders!</span><br>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his sovereignty is from generation to generation.</span></p></div> <p> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living at ease in my home and prospering in my palace.  I saw a dream that frightened me; my fantasies in bed and the visions of my head terrified me.  So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, in order that they might tell me the interpretation of the dream.  Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not tell me its interpretation.  At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and who is endowed with a spirit of the holy gods—and I told him the dream:  “O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that you are endowed with a spirit of the holy gods and that no mystery is too difficult for you. Hear the dream that I saw; tell me its interpretation.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line"> Upon my bed this is what I saw;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there was a tree at the center of the earth,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and its height was great.</span><br>The tree grew great and strong,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>its top reached to heaven,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth.</span><br>Its foliage was beautiful,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>its fruit abundant,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and it provided food for all.</span><br>The animals of the field found shade under it,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the birds of the air nested in its branches,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and from it all living beings were fed.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">“I continued looking, in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and there was a holy watcher, coming down from heaven.  He cried aloud and said:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Cut down the tree and chop off its branches,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit.</span><br>Let the animals flee from beneath it<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the birds from its branches.</span><br>But leave its stump and roots in the ground,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>with a band of iron and bronze,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the tender grass of the field.</span><br>Let him be bathed with the dew of heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and let his lot be with the animals of the field</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the grass of the earth.</span><br>Let his mind be changed from that of a human,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and let the mind of an animal be given to him.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>And let seven times pass over him.</span><br>The sentence is rendered by decree of the watchers,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the decision is given by order of the holy ones,</span><br>in order that all who live may know<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of mortals;</span><br>he gives it to whom he will<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and sets over it the lowliest of human beings.’</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">“This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to tell me the interpretation. You are able, however, for you are endowed with a spirit of the holy gods.”</p>

 <h3>A New Commandment</h3>
<p>Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word that you have heard.  Yet I am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.  Whoever says, “I am in the light,” while hating a brother or sister, is still in the darkness.  Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light, and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling.  But whoever hates another believer is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has brought on blindness.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">I am writing to you, little children,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.</span><br>I am writing to you, fathers,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because you know him who is from the beginning.</span><br>I am writing to you, young people,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because you have conquered the evil one.</span><br>I write to you, children,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because you know the Father.</span><br>I write to you, fathers,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because you know him who is from the beginning.</span><br>I write to you, young people,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because you are strong</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the word of God abides in you,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and you have overcome the evil one.</span></p></div> <p>Do not love the world or the things in the world. The love of the Father is not in those who love the world;  for all that is in the world—the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, the pride in riches—comes not from the Father but from the world.  And the world and its desire are passing away, but those who do the will of God live forever.</p>
