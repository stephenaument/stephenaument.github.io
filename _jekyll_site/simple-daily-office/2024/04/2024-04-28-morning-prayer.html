<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>The Rites of Ordination</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Take Aaron and his sons with him, the vestments, the anointing oil, the bull of sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;  and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.  And Moses did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting,  Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded to be done.”</p> <p>Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward, and washed them with water.  He put the tunic on him, fastened the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He then put the decorated band of the ephod around him, tying the ephod to him with it.  He placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.  And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden ornament, the holy crown, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p> <p>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.  He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to consecrate them.  He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.  And Moses brought forward Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and fastened sashes around them, and tied headdresses on them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>

 <p>Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his vestments, and also on his sons and their vestments. Thus he consecrated Aaron and his vestments, and also his sons and their vestments.</p> <p>And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it’;  and what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire.  You shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day when your period of ordination is completed. For it will take seven days to ordain you;  as has been done today, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.  You shall remain at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, keeping the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s charge so that you do not die; for so I am commanded.”  Aaron and his sons did all the things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded through Moses.</p>

 <h3>The Rejection of Jesus at Nazareth</h3>
<p>When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read,  and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>because he has anointed me</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>to bring good news to the poor.</span><br>He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and recovery of sight to the blind,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>to let the oppressed go free,</span><br>to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.  Then he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth. They said, “Is not this Joseph’s son?”  He said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘Doctor, cure yourself!’ And you will say, ‘Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.’”  And he said, “Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in the prophet’s hometown.  But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land;  yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.  There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”  When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage.  They got up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl him off the cliff.  But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.</p>
