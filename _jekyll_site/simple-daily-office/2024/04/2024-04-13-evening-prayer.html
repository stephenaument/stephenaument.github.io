<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Fiery Furnace</h3>
<p>Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary,  and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.  So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.  Because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.</p> <h3>The Prayer of Azariah in the Furnace</h3>
<p>They walked around in the midst of the flames, singing hymns to God and blessing the Lord.  Then Azariah stood still in the fire and prayed aloud:</p> <div class="poetry">
<p class="line">“Blessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and worthy of praise;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and glorious is your name forever!</span><br>For you are just in all you have done;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>all your works are true and your ways right,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and all your judgments are true.</span><br>You have executed true judgments in all you have brought upon us<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our ancestors;</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>by a true judgment you have brought all this upon us because of our sins.</span><br>For we have sinned and broken your law in turning away from you;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in all matters we have sinned grievously.</span><br>We have not obeyed your commandments,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>we have not kept them or done what you have commanded us for our own good.</span></p> </div>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers.  Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.  Be hospitable to one another without complaining.  Like good stewards of the manifold grace of God, serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received.  Whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of God; whoever serves must do so with the strength that God supplies, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</p> <h3>Suffering as a Christian</h3>
<p>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.  But rejoice insofar as you are sharing Christ’s sufferings, so that you may also be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed.  If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory, which is the Spirit of God, is resting on you.  But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, a criminal, or even as a mischief maker.  Yet if any of you suffers as a Christian, do not consider it a disgrace, but glorify God because you bear this name.  For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?  And</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>what will become of the ungodly and the sinners?”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore, let those suffering in accordance with God’s will entrust themselves to a faithful Creator, while continuing to do good.</p>
