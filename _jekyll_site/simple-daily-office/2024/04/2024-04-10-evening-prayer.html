<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</h3>
<p>Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,  and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish.  Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Daniel said:<br>“Blessed be the name of God from age to age,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for wisdom and power are his.</span><br>He changes times and seasons,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>deposes kings and sets up kings;</span><br>he gives wisdom to the wise<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and knowledge to those who have understanding.</span><br>He reveals deep and hidden things;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>he knows what is in the darkness,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and light dwells with him.</span><br>To you, O God of my ancestors,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I give thanks and praise,</span><br>for you have given me wisdom and power,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and have now revealed to me what we asked of you,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for you have revealed to us what the king ordered.”</span></p></div> <h3>Daniel Interprets the Dream</h3>
<p>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will give the king the interpretation.”</p> <p>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him: “I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can tell the king the interpretation.”  The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”  Daniel answered the king, “No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or diviners can show to the king the mystery that the king is asking,  but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has disclosed to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at the end of days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed were these:  To you, O king, as you lay in bed, came thoughts of what would be hereafter, and the revealer of mysteries disclosed to you what is to be.  But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living being, but in order that the interpretation may be known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.</p>

 <h3>The Living Stone and a Chosen People</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Rid yourselves, therefore, of all malice, and all guile, insincerity, envy, and all slander.  Like newborn infants, long for the pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation—  if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.</p> <p>Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and  like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.  For it stands in scripture:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“See, I am laying in Zion a stone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a cornerstone chosen and precious;</span><br>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The stone that the builders rejected<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>has become the very head of the corner,”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">and</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“A stone that makes them stumble,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and a rock that makes them fall.”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.</p> <p>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Once you were not a people,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now you are God’s people;</span><br>once you had not received mercy,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now you have received mercy.</span></p></div>

be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
