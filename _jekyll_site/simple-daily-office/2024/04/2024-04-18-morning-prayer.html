<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>The Ten Commandments</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then God spoke all these words:</p> <p>I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;  you shall have no other gods before me.</p> <p>You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me,  but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p> <p>You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.</p> <p>Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy.  Six days you shall labor and do all your work.  But the seventh day is a sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns.  For in six days the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.</p> <p>Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you.</p> <p>You shall not murder.</p> <p>You shall not commit adultery.</p> <p>You shall not steal.</p> <p>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</p> <p>You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.</p> <p>When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance,  and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.”  Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin.”  Then the people stood at a distance, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.</p>

 <h3>The Temptation of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.  He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished.  The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”  But he answered, “It is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘One does not live by bread alone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</span></p></div> <p>Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,  saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘He will command his angels concerning you,’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and ‘On their hands they will bear you up,</span><br>so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”</p> <p>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor;  and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”  Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! for it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Worship the Lord your God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and serve only him.’”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels came and waited on him.</p>
