<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>
</div>

 <h3>Exaltation through Abasement</h3>
<p>Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.  But someone has testified somewhere,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What are human beings that you are mindful of them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or mortals, that you care for them?</span><br>You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you have crowned them with glory and honor,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>subjecting all things under their feet.”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them,  but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p> <p>It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  </p>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>

 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>

 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>
 <p class="indent">the forgiveness of sins,</p>
 <p class="indent">the resurrection of the body,</p>

<h3>A Collect for the Renewal of Life</h3>
<p>O God, the King eternal, whose light divides the day from the night and turns the shadow of death into the morning: Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep your law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; that, having done your will with cheerfulness during the day, we may, when night comes, rejoice to give you thanks; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.
</p>


<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
