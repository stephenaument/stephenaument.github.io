<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

 <h3>Nebuchadnezzar’s Humiliation</h3>
<p>All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.  At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,  and the king said, “Is this not magnificent Babylon, which I have built as a royal capital by my mighty power and for my glorious majesty?”  While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has departed from you!  You shall be driven away from human society, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that the Most High has sovereignty over the kingdom of mortals and gives it to whom he will.”  Immediately the sentence was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven away from human society, ate grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers and his nails became like birds’ claws.</p> <h3>Nebuchadnezzar Praises God</h3>
<p>When that period was over, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me.</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">I blessed the Most High,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and praised and honored the one who lives forever.</span><br>For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his kingdom endures from generation to generation.</span><br>All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and he does what he wills with the host of heaven</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the inhabitants of the earth.</span><br>There is no one who can stay his hand<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or say to him, “What are you doing?”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">At that time my reason returned to me; and my majesty and splendor were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom. My counselors and my lords sought me out, I was re-established over my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me.  Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">for all his works are truth,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his ways are justice;</span><br>and he is able to bring low<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>those who walk in pride.</span></p></div>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</p> <p>To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father.</p> <h3>Paul Thanks God for the Colossians</h3>
<p>In our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,  because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth, the gospel  that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God.  This you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,  and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit.</p> <p>For this reason, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,  so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God.  May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power, and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience, while joyfully  giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.  He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,  in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</p>
