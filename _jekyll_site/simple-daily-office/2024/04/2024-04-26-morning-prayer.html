<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <p>You shall keep the festival of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.</p> <p>All that first opens the womb is mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.  The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.</p>
<p>No one shall appear before me empty-handed.</p> <p>Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest.  You shall observe the festival of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year.  Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, the God of Israel.  For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God three times in the year.</p> <p>You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice of the festival of the passover shall not be left until the morning.</p> <p>The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<p>You shall not boil a kid in its motherâ€™s milk.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses: Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.  He was there with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p> <h3>The Shining Face of Moses</h3>
<p>Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.  When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.  But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them.  Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.  When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face;  but whenever Moses went in before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,  the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>

 <h3>Concerning Adultery</h3>
<p>â€œYou have heard that it was said, â€˜You shall not commit adultery.â€™  But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.  And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.</p> <h3>Concerning Divorce</h3>
<p>â€œIt was also said, â€˜Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.â€™  But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p> <h3>Concerning Oaths</h3>
<p>â€œAgain, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, â€˜You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.â€™  But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,  or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.  And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.  Let your word be â€˜Yes, Yesâ€™ or â€˜No, Noâ€™; anything more than this comes from the evil one.</p>
