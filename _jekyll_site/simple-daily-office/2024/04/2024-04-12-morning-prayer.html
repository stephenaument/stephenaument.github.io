<div class="citation">Hebrews 9:24</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<div class="citation">1 Corinthians 5:7-8; Romans 6:9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:20-22</div>
<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>
</div>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Protect me, O God, for I take refuge in you; *</p> <p class="indent">I have said to the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, "You are my Lord,</p> <p class="indent">my good above all other."</p> <p>All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, *</p> <p class="indent">upon those who are noble among the people.</p> <p class="space">But those who run after other gods *</p> <p class="indent">shall have their troubles multiplied.</p> <p class="space">Their libations of blood I will not offer, *</p> <p class="indent">nor take the names of their gods upon my lips.</p> <p class="space">O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, you are my portion and my cup; *</p> <p class="indent">it is you who uphold my lot.</p> <p class="space">My boundaries enclose a pleasant land; *</p> <p class="indent">indeed, I have a goodly heritage.</p> <p class="space">I will bless the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> who gives me counsel; *</p> <p class="indent">my heart teaches me, night after night.</p> <p class="space">I have set the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> always before me; *</p> <p class="indent">because he is at my right hand I shall not fall.</p> <p class="space">My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; *</p> <p class="indent">my body also shall rest in hope.</p> <p class="space">For you will not abandon me to the grave, *</p> <p class="indent">nor let your holy one see the Pit.</p> <p class="space">You will show me the path of life; *</p> <p class="indent">in your presence there is fullness of joy,</p> <p class="indent">and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.</p>

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<h3>Exod 16:23-36</h3>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> he said to them, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.’”  So they put it aside until morning, as Moses commanded them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it.  Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; today you will not find it in the field.  Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none.”</p> <p>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and instructions?  See! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he gives you food for two days; each of you stay where you are; do not leave your place on the seventh day.”  So the people rested on the seventh day.</p> <p>The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.  Moses said, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, in order that they may see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”  And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to be kept throughout your generations.”  As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the covenant, for safekeeping.  The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land; they ate manna, until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.  An omer is a tenth of an ephah.</p>

<h3>10. The Second Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Quaerite Dominum</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>John 16:1-15</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-2">“I have said these things to you to keep you from stumbling.  They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, an hour is coming when those who kill you will think that by doing so they are offering worship to God.  And they will do this because they have not known the Father or me.  But I have said these things to you so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you about them.</p>
<h3>The Work of the Spirit</h3>
<p>“I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you.  But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’  But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.  Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.  And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment:  about sin, because they do not believe in me;  about righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer;  about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.</p> <p>“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.  When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.  He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you.  All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</p>
