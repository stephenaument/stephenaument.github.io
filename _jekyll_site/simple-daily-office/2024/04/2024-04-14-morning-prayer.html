<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>Jethro’s Advice</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had brought Israel out of Egypt.  After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro took her back,  along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been an alien in a foreign land”),  and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).  Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came into the wilderness where Moses was encamped at the mountain of God, bringing Moses’ sons and wife to him.  He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, with your wife and her two sons.”  Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed down and kissed him; each asked after the other’s welfare, and they went into the tent.  Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had beset them on the way, and how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had delivered them.  Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had done to Israel, in delivering them from the Egyptians.</p> <p>Jethro said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who has delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh.  Now I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is greater than all gods, because he delivered the people from the Egyptians, when they dealt arrogantly with them.”  And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.</p>

<h3>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</h3>
<p>[[Now after he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.  She went out and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping.  But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.</p> <h3>Jesus Appears to Two Disciples</h3>
<p>After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.  And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.</p> <h3>Jesus Commissions the Disciples</h3>
<p>Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.  And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation.  The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.  And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;  they will pick up snakes in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</p> <h3>The Ascension of Jesus</h3>
<p>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.  And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it.]]</p>
