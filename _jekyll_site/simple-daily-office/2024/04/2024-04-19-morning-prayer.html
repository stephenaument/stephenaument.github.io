<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>The Blood of the Covenant</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then he said to Moses, “Come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship at a distance.  Moses alone shall come near the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.”</p> <p>Moses came and told the people all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, “All the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.”  And Moses wrote down all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. He rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel.  He sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed oxen as offerings of well-being to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he dashed against the altar.  Then he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, “All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”  Moses took the blood and dashed it on the people, and said, “See the blood of the covenant that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has made with you in accordance with all these words.”</p> <h3>On the Mountain with God</h3>
<p>Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up,  and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was something like a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.  God did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; also they beheld God, and they ate and drank.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and wait there; and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.”  So Moses set out with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God.  To the elders he had said, “Wait here for us, until we come to you again; for Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a dispute may go to them.”</p> <p>Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.  The glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the cloud.  Now the appearance of the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel.  Moses entered the cloud, and went up on the mountain. Moses was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Begins His Ministry in Galilee</h3>
<p>Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.  He left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,  so that what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on the road by the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—</span><br>the people who sat in darkness<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>have seen a great light,</span><br>and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>light has dawned.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">From that time Jesus began to proclaim, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”</p>

Amen.
