<div class="citation">Hebrews 9:24</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>
</div>

<h3>Exod 12:28-39</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>The Israelites went and did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron.</p> <h3>The Tenth Plague: Death of the Firstborn</h3>
<p>At midnight the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.  Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his officials and all the Egyptians; and there was a loud cry in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.  Then he summoned Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, “Rise up, go away from my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, as you said.  Take your flocks and your herds, as you said, and be gone. And bring a blessing on me too!”</p> <h3>The Exodus: From Rameses to Succoth</h3>
<p>The Egyptians urged the people to hasten their departure from the land, for they said, “We shall all be dead.”  So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders.  The Israelites had done as Moses told them; they had asked the Egyptians for jewelry of silver and gold, and for clothing,  and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And so they plundered the Egyptians.</p> <p>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.  A mixed crowd also went up with them, and livestock in great numbers, both flocks and herds.  They baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt; it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.</p>

<h3>13. A Song of Praise <em class="latin_name">Benedictus es, Domine</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; *</p> <p class="indent">you are worthy of praise; glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; *</p> <p class="indent">on the throne of your majesty, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you, beholding the depths; *</p> <p class="indent">in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> Do you still not perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?  Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?  How could you fail to perceive that I was not speaking about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”  Then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p> <h3>Peter’s Declaration about Jesus</h3>
<p>Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”  And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”  He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”  Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”  And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven.  And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”  Then he sternly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</p>

 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
