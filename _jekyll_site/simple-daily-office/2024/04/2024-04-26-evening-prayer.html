<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Description of Wisdom</h3>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">Wisdom is radiant and unfading,<br>and she is easily discerned by those who love her,<br>and is found by those who seek her.<br>She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her.<br>One who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty,<br>for she will be found sitting at the gate.<br>To fix one’s thought on her is perfect understanding,<br>and one who is vigilant on her account will soon be free from care,<br>because she goes about seeking those worthy of her,<br>and she graciously appears to them in their paths,<br>and meets them in every thought.</p></div> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere desire for instruction,<br>and concern for instruction is love of her,<br>and love of her is the keeping of her laws,<br>and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality,<br>and immortality brings one near to God;<br>so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.</p></div> <div class="poetry top-1">
<p class="line">Therefore if you delight in thrones and scepters, O monarchs over the peoples,<br>honor wisdom, so that you may reign forever.<br>I will tell you what wisdom is and how she came to be,<br>and I will hide no secrets from you,<br>but I will trace her course from the beginning of creation,<br>and make knowledge of her clear,<br>and I will not pass by the truth;<br>nor will I travel in the company of sickly envy,<br>for envy does not associate with wisdom.</p> </div>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-1">Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we decided to be left alone in Athens;  and we sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker for God in proclaiming the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith,  so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions. Indeed, you yourselves know that this is what we are destined for.  In fact, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution; so it turned out, as you know.  For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith; I was afraid that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor had been in vain.</p> <h3>Timothy’s Encouraging Report</h3>
<p>But Timothy has just now come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love. He has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see us—just as we long to see you.  For this reason, brothers and sisters, during all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you through your faith.  For we now live, if you continue to stand firm in the Lord.  How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our God because of you?  Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith.</p> <p>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you.  And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we abound in love for you.  And may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</p>

Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
