<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>Bitter Water Made Sweet</h3>
<p>Then Moses ordered Israel to set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water.  When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter. That is why it was called Marah.  And the people complained against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?”  He cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> showed him a piece of wood; he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet.</p>
<p>There the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he put them to the test.  He said, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and do what is right in his sight, and give heed to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who heals you.”</p> <p>Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they camped there by the water.</p> <h3>Bread from Heaven</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The whole congregation of the Israelites set out from Elim; and Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.  The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.  The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate our fill of bread; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day. In that way I will test them, whether they will follow my instruction or not.  On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days.”  So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you shall know that it was the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who brought you out of the land of Egypt,  and in the morning you shall see the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because he has heard your complaining against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. For what are we, that you complain against us?”  And Moses said, “When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives you meat to eat in the evening and your fill of bread in the morning, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has heard the complaining that you utter against him—what are we? Your complaining is not against us but against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, ‘Draw near to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he has heard your complaining.’”  And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they looked toward the wilderness, and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared in the cloud.  </p> <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Jesus the True Vine</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower.  He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.  You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.  Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me.  I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.  Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.  My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.  As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.  If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.  I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.</p>
