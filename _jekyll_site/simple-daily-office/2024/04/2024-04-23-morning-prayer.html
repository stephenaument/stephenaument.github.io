<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>
</div>

 <p>Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?”  And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are bent on evil.  They said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’  So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off’; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”</p> <p>When Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them run wild, to the derision of their enemies),  then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s side? Come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.  He said to them, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side, each of you! Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill your brother, your friend, and your neighbor.’”  The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand of the people fell on that day.  Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, each one at the cost of a son or a brother, and so have brought a blessing on yourselves this day.”</p> <p>On the next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. But now I will go up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”  So Moses returned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.  But now, if you will only forgive their sin—but if not, blot me out of the book that you have written.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.  But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; see, my angel shall go in front of you. Nevertheless, when the day comes for punishment, I will punish them for their sin.”</p>

 <p>“Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p> <h3>Salt and Light</h3>
<p>“You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.</p> <p>“You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.  No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.  In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</p>
