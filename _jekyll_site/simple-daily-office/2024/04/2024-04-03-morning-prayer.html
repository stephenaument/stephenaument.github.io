<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <p>The time that the Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.  At the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the companies of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went out from the land of Egypt.  That was for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> a night of vigil, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. That same night is a vigil to be kept for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by all the Israelites throughout their generations.</p> <h3>Directions for the Passover</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance for the passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,  but any slave who has been purchased may eat of it after he has been circumcised;  no bound or hired servant may eat of it.  It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the animal outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.  The whole congregation of Israel shall celebrate it.  If an alien who resides with you wants to celebrate the passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, all his males shall be circumcised; then he may draw near to celebrate it; he shall be regarded as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it;  there shall be one law for the native and for the alien who resides among you.</p> <p>All the Israelites did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron.  That very day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, company by company.</p>

 <h3>The Resurrection of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.  And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.  His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.  For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.  But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.  He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.  Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ This is my message for you.”  So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.  Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.  Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”</p> <h3>The Report of the Guard</h3>
<p>While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.  After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers,  telling them, “You must say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’  If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”  So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.</p> <h3>The Commissioning of the Disciples</h3>
<p>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.  </p>
