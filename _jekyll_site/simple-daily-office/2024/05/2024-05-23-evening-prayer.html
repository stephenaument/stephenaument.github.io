<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, I need to seek some security for you, so that it may be well with you.  Now here is our kinsman Boaz, with whose young women you have been working. See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.  Now wash and anoint yourself, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.  When he lies down, observe the place where he lies; then, go and uncover his feet and lie down; and he will tell you what to do.”  She said to her, “All that you tell me I will do.”</p> <p>So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had instructed her.  When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and he was in a contented mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came stealthily and uncovered his feet, and lay down.  At midnight the man was startled, and turned over, and there, lying at his feet, was a woman!  He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your servant; spread your cloak over your servant, for you are next-of-kin.”  He said, “May you be blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, my daughter; this last instance of your loyalty is better than the first; you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.  And now, my daughter, do not be afraid, I will do for you all that you ask, for all the assembly of my people know that you are a worthy woman.  But now, though it is true that I am a near kinsman, there is another kinsman more closely related than I.  Remain this night, and in the morning, if he will act as next-of-kin for you, good; let him do it. If he is not willing to act as next-of-kin for you, then, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, I will act as next-of-kin for you. Lie down until the morning.”</p> <p>So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before one person could recognize another; for he said, “It must not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”  Then he said, “Bring the cloak you are wearing and hold it out.” So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley, and put it on her back; then he went into the city.  She came to her mother-in-law, who said, “How did things go with you, my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her,  saying, “He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”  She replied, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today.”</p>

 <h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.</p> <p>And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.  And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him.  If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one—to those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that.  All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal.</p> <p>We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one does not touch them.  We know that we are God’s children, and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one.  And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</p> <p>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>
