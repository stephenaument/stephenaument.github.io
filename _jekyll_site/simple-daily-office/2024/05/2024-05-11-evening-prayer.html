<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>He said to me: Mortal, go to the house of Israel and speak my very words to them.  For you are not sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel—  not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.  But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me; because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.  See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.  Like the hardest stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not fear them or be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.  He said to me: Mortal, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart and hear with your ears;  then go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them. Say to them, “Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>”; whether they hear or refuse to hear.</p> <h3>Ezekiel at the River Chebar</h3>
<p>Then the spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> rose from its place, I heard behind me the sound of loud rumbling;  it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that sounded like a loud rumbling.  The spirit lifted me up and bore me away; I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> being strong upon me.  I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat there among them, stunned, for seven days.</p> <p>At the end of seven days, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me:  Mortal, I have made you a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.  </p>

 <h3>One in Christ</h3>
<p>So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called “the uncircumcision” by those who are called “the circumcision”—a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands—  remember that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.  But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.  For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us.  He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace,  and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it.  So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near;  for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father.  So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God,  built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone.  In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord;  in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.</p>
