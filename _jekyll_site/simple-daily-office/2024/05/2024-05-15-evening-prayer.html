<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>God Will Restore Israel</h3>
<p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me:  Mortal, your kinsfolk, your own kin, your fellow exiles, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, “They have gone far from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; to us this land is given for a possession.”  Therefore say: Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: Though I removed them far away among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries where they have gone.  Therefore say: Thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.  When they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations.  I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them; I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh,  so that they may follow my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them. Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God.  But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</p> <p>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.  And the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> ascended from the middle of the city, and stopped on the mountain east of the city.  The spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen left me.  And I told the exiles all the things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had shown me.</p>

 <h3>Unity in the Body of Christ</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called,  with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,  making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.  There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling,  one Lord, one faith, one baptism,  one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.</p> <p>But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift.  Therefore it is said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>he gave gifts to his people.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">(When it says, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?  He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)  The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,  to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,  until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.  We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming.  But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,  from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.</p>
