<div class="citation">Colossians 3:1</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <p>If any of your kin fall into difficulty and become dependent on you, you shall support them; they shall live with you as though resident aliens.  Do not take interest in advance or otherwise make a profit from them, but fear your God; let them live with you.  You shall not lend them your money at interest taken in advance, or provide them food at a profit.  I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.</p> <p>If any who are dependent on you become so impoverished that they sell themselves to you, you shall not make them serve as slaves.  They shall remain with you as hired or bound laborers. They shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.  Then they and their children with them shall be free from your authority; they shall go back to their own family and return to their ancestral property.  For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.  You shall not rule over them with harshness, but shall fear your God.  As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves.  You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property.  You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property. These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness.</p> <p>If resident aliens among you prosper, and if any of your kin fall into difficulty with one of them and sell themselves to an alien, or to a branch of the alien’s family,  after they have sold themselves they shall have the right of redemption; one of their brothers may redeem them,  or their uncle or their uncle’s son may redeem them, or anyone of their family who is of their own flesh may redeem them; or if they prosper they may redeem themselves.  They shall compute with the purchaser the total from the year when they sold themselves to the alien until the jubilee year; the price of the sale shall be applied to the number of years: the time they were with the owner shall be rated as the time of a hired laborer.  If many years remain, they shall pay for their redemption in proportion to the purchase price;  and if few years remain until the jubilee year, they shall compute thus: according to the years involved they shall make payment for their redemption.  As a laborer hired by the year they shall be under the alien’s authority, who shall not, however, rule with harshness over them in your sight.  And if they have not been redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children with them shall go free in the jubilee year.  For to me the people of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Sower</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.  Such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there, while the whole crowd stood on the beach.  And he told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow.  And as he sowed, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them up.  Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil.  But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered away.  Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.  Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.  Let anyone with ears listen!”</p> <h3>The Purpose of the Parables</h3>
<p>Then the disciples came and asked him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”  He answered, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.  For to those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.  The reason I speak to them in parables is that ‘seeing they do not perceive, and hearing they do not listen, nor do they understand.’  With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘You will indeed listen, but never understand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and you will indeed look, but never perceive.</span><br>For this people’s heart has grown dull,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and their ears are hard of hearing,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and they have shut their eyes;</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>so that they might not look with their eyes,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and listen with their ears,</span><br>and understand with their heart and turn—<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I would heal them.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.  </p>
