<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Since you saw no form when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire, take care and watch yourselves closely,  so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in the form of any figureâ€”the likeness of male or female,  the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,  the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.  And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere under heaven.  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has taken you and brought you out of the iron-smelter, out of Egypt, to become a people of his very own possession, as you are now.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with me because of you, and he vowed that I should not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving for your possession.  For I am going to die in this land without crossing over the Jordan, but you are going to cross over to take possession of that good land.  So be careful not to forget the covenant that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God made with you, and not to make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has forbidden you.  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</p>

 <p>I am giving you these instructions, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,  having faith and a good conscience.

<p class="chapter-1">First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone,  for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity.
