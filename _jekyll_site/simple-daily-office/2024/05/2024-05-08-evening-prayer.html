<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elijah Ascends to Heaven</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.  Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.  The company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will take your master away from you?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent.”</p> <p>Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.  The company of prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will take your master away from you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know; be silent.”</p> <p>Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.  Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.  Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.</p> <p>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.”  He responded, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.”  As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven.  Elisha kept watching and crying out, “Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.</p> <h3>Elisha Succeeds Elijah</h3>
<p>He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.  He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, “Where is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Elijah?” When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.</p> <p>When the company of prophets who were at Jericho saw him at a distance, they declared, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.  </p>

 <h3>The Scroll and the Lamb</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals;  and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”  And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.  And I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.  Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p> <p>Then I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.  He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.  When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.  They sing a new song:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are worthy to take the scroll<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and to open its seals,</span><br>for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for God<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>saints from every tribe and language and people and nation;</span><br>you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and they will reign on earth.”</span></p></div> <p>Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,  singing with full voice,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered<br>to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might<br>and honor and glory and blessing!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb<br>be blessing and honor and glory and might<br>forever and ever!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the elders fell down and worshiped.</p>
