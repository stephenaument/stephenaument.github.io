<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>The Festival of Trumpets</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of complete rest, a holy convocation commemorated with trumpet blasts.  You shall not work at your occupations; and you shall present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offering by fire.</p> <h3>The Day of Atonement</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Now, the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you: you shall deny yourselves and present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offering by fire;  and you shall do no work during that entire day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  For anyone who does not practice self-denial during that entire day shall be cut off from the people.  And anyone who does any work during that entire day, such a one I will destroy from the midst of the people.  You shall do no work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your settlements.  It shall be to you a sabbath of complete rest, and you shall deny yourselves; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening you shall keep your sabbath.</p> <h3>The Festival of Booths</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, and lasting seven days, there shall be the festival of booths to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.  Seven days you shall present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offerings by fire; on the eighth day you shall observe a holy convocation and present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offerings by fire; it is a solemn assembly; you shall not work at your occupations.</p> <p>These are the appointed festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which you shall celebrate as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> offerings by fire—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day—  apart from the sabbaths of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your votive offerings, and apart from all your freewill offerings, which you give to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Now, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the festival of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, lasting seven days; a complete rest on the first day, and a complete rest on the eighth day.  On the first day you shall take the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God for seven days.  You shall keep it as a festival to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> seven days in the year; you shall keep it in the seventh month as a statute forever throughout your generations.  You shall live in booths for seven days; all that are citizens in Israel shall live in booths,  so that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p> <p>Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>The Narrow Gate</h3>
<p>“Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction, and there are many who take it.  For the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life, and there are few who find it.</p> <h3>A Tree and Its Fruit</h3>
<p>“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?  In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.  A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.  Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.  Thus you will know them by their fruits.</p> <h3>Concerning Self-Deception</h3>
