<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>
</div>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Appointed Festivals</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: These are the appointed festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that you shall proclaim as holy convocations, my appointed festivals.</p> <h3>The Sabbath, Passover, and Unleavened Bread</h3>
<p>Six days shall work be done; but the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no work: it is a sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> throughout your settlements.</p> <p>These are the appointed festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the holy convocations, which you shall celebrate at the time appointed for them.  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, there shall be a passover offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,  and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the festival of unleavened bread to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.  On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.  For seven days you shall present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offerings by fire; on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation: you shall not work at your occupations.</p> <h3>The Offering of First Fruits</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses:  Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you and you reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.  He shall raise the sheaf before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that you may find acceptance; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall raise it.  On the day when you raise the sheaf, you shall offer a lamb a year old, without blemish, as a burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And the grain offering with it shall be two-tenths of an ephah of choice flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, one-fourth of a hin.  You shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears until that very day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your settlements.</p> <h3>The Festival of Weeks</h3>
<p>And from the day after the sabbath, from the day on which you bring the sheaf of the elevation offering, you shall count off seven weeks; they shall be complete.  You shall count until the day after the seventh sabbath, fifty days; then you shall present an offering of new grain to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  You shall bring from your settlements two loaves of bread as an elevation offering, each made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of choice flour, baked with leaven, as first fruits to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  You shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, one young bull, and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, along with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of well-being.  The priest shall raise them with the bread of the first fruits as an elevation offering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, together with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for the priest.  On that same day you shall make proclamation; you shall hold a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations. This is a statute forever in all your settlements throughout your generations.</p> <p>When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the alien: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

 <h3>Do Not Worry</h3>
<p>“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?  Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?  And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?  And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin,  yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these.  But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?  Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’  For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.  But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</p> <p>“So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.</p>
