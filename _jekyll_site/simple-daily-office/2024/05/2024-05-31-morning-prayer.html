<h3 class="title">May 31 The Visitation Of Mary To Elizabeth</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samuel’s Birth and Dedication</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p> <p>Now this man used to go up year by year from his town to worship and to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;  but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed her womb.  Her rival used to provoke her severely, to irritate her, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed her womb.  So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.  Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”</p> <p>After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  She was deeply distressed and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and wept bitterly.  She made this vow: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head.”</p> <p>As she continued praying before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth.  Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  So Eli said to her, “How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine.”  But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.”  Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.”  And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.</p> <p>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> remembered her.  In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p>

 <h3>Moses a Servant, Christ a Son</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore, brothers and sisters, holy partners in a heavenly calling, consider that Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,  was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also “was faithful in all God’s house.”  Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.  (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)  Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken later.  Christ, however, was faithful over God’s house as a son, and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope.</p>

Amen.
