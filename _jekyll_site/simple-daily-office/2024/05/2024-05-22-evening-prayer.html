<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <h3>Psalm 12</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Help me, L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for there is no godly one left; *</p> <p class="indent">the faithful have vanished from among us.</p> <p class="space">Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *</p> <p class="indent">with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.</p> <p class="space">Oh, that the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> would cut off all smooth tongues, *</p> <p class="indent">and close the lips that utter proud boasts!</p> <p class="space">Those who say, "With our tongue will we prevail; *</p> <p class="indent">our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"</p> <p>"Because the needy are oppressed,</p> <p>and the poor cry out in misery, *</p> <p class="indent">I will rise up," says the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>,</p> <p class="indent">"and give them the help they long for."</p> <p>&nbsp;The words of the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> are pure words, *</p> <p class="indent">like silver refined from ore</p> <p class="indent">and purified seven times in the fire.</p> <p class="space">O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, watch over us *</p> <p class="indent">and save us from this generation for ever.</p> <p class="space">The wicked prowl on every side, *</p> <p class="indent">and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some of this bread, and dip your morsel in the sour wine.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he heaped up for her some parched grain. She ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over.  When she got up to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, “Let her glean even among the standing sheaves, and do not reproach her.  You must also pull out some handfuls for her from the bundles, and leave them for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.”</p> <p>So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.  She picked it up and came into the town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gleaned. Then she took out and gave her what was left over after she herself had been satisfied.  Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.”  Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “Blessed be he by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!” Naomi also said to her, “The man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin.”  Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay close by my servants, until they have finished all my harvest.’”  Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, “It is better, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, otherwise you might be bothered in another field.”  So she stayed close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</p>

 <h3>Faith Conquers the World</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child.  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.  For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,  for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith.  Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p> <h3>Testimony concerning the Son of God</h3>
<p>This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth.  There are three that testify:  the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree.  If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son.  Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.  And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>
