<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elimelech’s Family Goes to Moab</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he and his wife and two sons.  The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.  But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons.  These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years,  both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.</p> <h3>Naomi and Her Moabite Daughters-in-Law</h3>
<p>Then she started to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had considered his people and given them food.  So she set out from the place where she had been living, she and her two daughters-in-law, and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah.  But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back each of you to your mother’s house. May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> grant that you may find security, each of you in the house of your husband.” Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud.  They said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”  But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?  Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I should have a husband tonight and bear sons,  would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, it has been far more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has turned against me.”  Then they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</p> <p>So she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”  But Ruth said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Do not press me to leave you<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or to turn back from following you!</span><br>Where you go, I will go;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>where you lodge, I will lodge;</span><br>your people shall be my people,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your God my God.</span><br>Where you die, I will die—<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there will I be buried.</span><br>May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> do thus and so to me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and more as well,</span><br>if even death parts me from you!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her.</p>

<h3>1 John 3:18-4:6</h3>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.  And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him  whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.  Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness before God;  and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him.</p> <p>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us.  All who obey his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given us.</p> <h3>Testing the Spirits</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world.  By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,  and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world.  Little children, you are from God, and have conquered them; for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.  They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them.  We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
