<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> Then Moses went up to God; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the Israelites:  You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.  Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession out of all the peoples. Indeed, the whole earth is mine,  but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the Israelites.”</p> <p>So Moses came, summoned the elders of the people, and set before them all these words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him.  The people all answered as one: “Everything that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.” Moses reported the words of the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  </p>

 <p>On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, as well as a thick cloud on the mountain, and a blast of a trumpet so loud that all the people who were in the camp trembled.  Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God. They took their stand at the foot of the mountain.  Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had descended upon it in fire; the smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, while the whole mountain shook violently.  As the blast of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses would speak and God would answer him in thunder.  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> descended upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.  </p>

 <p>Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and  like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.  For it stands in scripture:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“See, I am laying in Zion a stone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a cornerstone chosen and precious;</span><br>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe,</p>

<p class="first-line-none">They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.</p> <p>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Once you were not a people,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now you are God’s people;</span><br>once you had not received mercy,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now you have received mercy.</span></p></div>
