<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>But take care and watch yourselves closely, so as neither to forget the things that your eyes have seen nor to let them slip from your mind all the days of your life; make them known to your children and your children’s children—  how you once stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God at Horeb, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Assemble the people for me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me as long as they live on the earth, and may teach their children so”;  you approached and stood at the foot of the mountain while the mountain was blazing up to the very heavens, shrouded in dark clouds.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.

  <p>I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; *</p> <p class="indent">the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.</p> <p>The Lord is my strength and my refuge; *</p> <p class="indent">the Lord has become my Savior.</p> <p>This is my God and I will praise him, *</p> <p class="indent">the God of my people and I will exalt him.</p> <p>The Lord is a mighty warrior; *</p> <p class="indent">Yahweh is his Name.</p> <p>The chariots of Pharaoh and his army has he hurled into the sea; *</p> <p class="indent">the finest of those who bear armor have been drowned in the Red Sea.</p> <p>The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; *</p> <p class="indent">they sank into the depths like a stone.</p> <p>Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; *</p> <p class="indent">your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.</p> <p>Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? *</p> <p class="indent">who is like you, glorious in holiness,</p> <p class="indent">awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?</p> <p>You stretched forth your right hand; *</p> <p class="indent">the earth swallowed them up.</p> <p>With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *</p> <p class="indent">with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.</p> <p>You will bring them in and plant them *</p> <p class="indent">on the mount of your possession,</p> <p>The resting-place you have made for yourself, O Lord, *</p> <p class="indent">the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hand has established.</p> <p>The Lord shall reign *</p> <p class="indent">for ever and for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</p> <p>To Timothy, my loyal child in the faith:</p>
<p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p> <h3>Warning against False Teachers</h3>
<p>I urge you, as I did when I was on my way to Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine,  and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith.  But the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.  Some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk,  desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions.</p> <p>Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it legitimately.  This means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient, for the godless and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their father or mother, for murderers,  fornicators, sodomites, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching  that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</p> <h3>Gratitude for Mercy</h3>
<p>I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service,  even though I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a man of violence. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,  and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the foremost.  But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display the utmost patience, making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life.  To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
