<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>The Sabbatical Year</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land shall observe a sabbath for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in their yield;  but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of complete rest for the land, a sabbath for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.  You shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your unpruned vine: it shall be a year of complete rest for the land.  You may eat what the land yields during its sabbath—you, your male and female slaves, your hired and your bound laborers who live with you;  for your livestock also, and for the wild animals in your land all its yield shall be for food.</p> <h3>The Year of Jubilee</h3>
<p>You shall count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the period of seven weeks of years gives forty-nine years.  Then you shall have the trumpet sounded loud; on the tenth day of the seventh month—on the day of atonement—you shall have the trumpet sounded throughout all your land.  And you shall hallow the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you: you shall return, every one of you, to your property and every one of you to your family.  That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you: you shall not sow, or reap the aftergrowth, or harvest the unpruned vines.  For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat only what the field itself produces.</p> <p>In this year of jubilee you shall return, every one of you, to your property.  When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not cheat one another.  When you buy from your neighbor, you shall pay only for the number of years since the jubilee; the seller shall charge you only for the remaining crop years.  If the years are more, you shall increase the price, and if the years are fewer, you shall diminish the price; for it is a certain number of harvests that are being sold to you.  You shall not cheat one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Rich Fool</h3>
<p>Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.”  But he said to him, “Friend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?”  And he said to them, “Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.”  Then he told them a parable: “The land of a rich man produced abundantly.  And he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?’  Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.  And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.’  But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’  So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.”</p>
