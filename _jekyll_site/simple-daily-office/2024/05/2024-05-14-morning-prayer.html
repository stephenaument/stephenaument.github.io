<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>David Anointed as King</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”  Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’  Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.”  Samuel did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”  He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</p> <p>When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed is now before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> looks on the heart.”  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has not chosen any of these.”  Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”  He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.”  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.</p>

 <h3>Would-Be Followers of Jesus</h3>
<p>Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.  A scribe then approached and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”  And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”  Another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”  But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</p> <h3>Jesus Stills the Storm</h3>
<p>And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.  A windstorm arose on the sea, so great that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.  And they went and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”  And he said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a dead calm.  They were amazed, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”</p>
