<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats:  Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture? When you drink of clear water, must you foul the rest with your feet?  And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet?</p> <p>Therefore, thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.  Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide,  I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.</p> <p>I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.  And I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, have spoken.</p> <p>I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild animals from the land, so that they may live in the wild and sleep in the woods securely.  I will make them and the region around my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.  The trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase. They shall be secure on their soil; and they shall know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I break the bars of their yoke, and save them from the hands of those who enslaved them.  They shall no more be plunder for the nations, nor shall the animals of the land devour them; they shall live in safety, and no one shall make them afraid.  I will provide for them a splendid vegetation so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the insults of the nations.  They shall know that I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.  You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture and I am your God, says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</p>

  <p>Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; *</p> <p class="indent">you are worthy of praise; glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; *</p> <p class="indent">on the throne of your majesty, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you, beholding the depths; *</p> <p class="indent">in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children,  and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</p> <h3>Renounce Pagan Ways</h3>
<p>But fornication and impurity of any kind, or greed, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among saints.  Entirely out of place is obscene, silly, and vulgar talk; but instead, let there be thanksgiving.  Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure person, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p> <p>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on those who are disobedient.  Therefore do not be associated with them.  For once you were darkness, but now in the Lord you are light. Live as children of light—  for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true.  Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.  For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly;  but everything exposed by the light becomes visible,  for everything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Sleeper, awake!<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Rise from the dead,</span><br>and Christ will shine on you.”</p></div> <p>Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise,  making the most of the time, because the days are evil.  So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,  as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,  giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>

We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
