<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>Fifth Vision: The Lampstand and Olive Trees</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as one is wakened from sleep.  He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it; there are seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.  And by it there are two olive trees, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”  I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”  Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”  He said to me, “This is the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring out the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”</p> <p>Moreover the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me, saying,  “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts has sent me to you.  For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.</p>
<p>“These seven are the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which range through the whole earth.”  Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”  And a second time I said to him, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which pour out the oil through the two golden pipes?”  He said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”  Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”</p>

<p> And after getting into a boat he crossed the sea and came to his own town.</p> <h3>Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h3>
<p>And just then some people were carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”  Then some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.”  But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?  For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?  But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralytic—“Stand up, take your bed and go to your home.”  And he stood up and went to his home.  When the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to human beings.</p>
