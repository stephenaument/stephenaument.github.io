<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elijah’s Triumph over the Priests of Baal</h3>
<p>So Ahab sent to all the Israelites, and assembled the prophets at Mount Carmel.  Elijah then came near to all the people, and said, “How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” The people did not answer him a word.  Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but Baal’s prophets number four hundred fifty.  Let two bulls be given to us; let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it; I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it.  Then you call on the name of your god and I will call on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the god who answers by fire is indeed God.” All the people answered, “Well spoken!”  Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many; then call on the name of your god, but put no fire to it.”  So they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, crying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no answer. They limped about the altar that they had made.  At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.”  Then they cried aloud and, as was their custom, they cut themselves with swords and lances until the blood gushed out over them.  As midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice, no answer, and no response.</p> <p>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come closer to me”; and all the people came closer to him. First he repaired the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that had been thrown down;  Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came, saying, “Israel shall be your name”;  with the stones he built an altar in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Then he made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of seed.  Next he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”  Then he said, “Do it a second time”; and they did it a second time. Again he said, “Do it a third time”; and they did it a third time,  so that the water ran all around the altar, and filled the trench also with water.</p> <p>At the time of the offering of the oblation, the prophet Elijah came near and said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your bidding.  Answer me, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, answer me, so that this people may know that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.”  Then the fire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and even licked up the water that was in the trench.  When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> indeed is God; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> indeed is God.”  Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.” Then they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon, and killed them there.</p>

 <p>The whole assembly kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul as they told of all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.  After they finished speaking, James replied, “My brothers, listen to me.  Simeon has related how God first looked favorably on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name.  This agrees with the words of the prophets, as it is written,</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘After this I will return,<br>and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>from its ruins I will rebuild it,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and I will set it up,</span><br>so that all other peoples may seek the Lord—<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>even all the Gentiles over whom my name has been called.</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>Thus says the Lord, who has been making these things  known from long ago.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore I have reached the decision that we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God,  but we should write to them to abstain only from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood.

not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
