<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Miracle of the Ax Head</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the company of prophets said to Elisha, “As you see, the place where we live under your charge is too small for us.  Let us go to the Jordan, and let us collect logs there, one for each of us, and build a place there for us to live.” He answered, “Do so.”  Then one of them said, “Please come with your servants.” And he answered, “I will.”  So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.  But as one was felling a log, his ax head fell into the water; he cried out, “Alas, master! It was borrowed.”  Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float.  He said, “Pick it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.</p> <h3>The Aramean Attack Is Thwarted</h3>
<p>Once when the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he took counsel with his officers. He said, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”  But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Take care not to pass this place, because the Arameans are going down there.”  The king of Israel sent word to the place of which the man of God spoke. More than once or twice he warned such a place so that it was on the alert.</p> <p>The mind of the king of Aram was greatly perturbed because of this; he called his officers and said to them, “Now tell me who among us sides with the king of Israel?”  Then one of his officers said, “No one, my lord king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.”  He said, “Go and find where he is; I will send and seize him.” He was told, “He is in Dothan.”  So he sent horses and chariots there and a great army; they came by night, and surrounded the city.</p> <p>When an attendant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. His servant said, “Alas, master! What shall we do?”  He replied, “Do not be afraid, for there are more with us than there are with them.”  Then Elisha prayed: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, please open his eyes that he may see.” So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.  When the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “Strike this people, please, with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.  Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.</p> <p>As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, open the eyes of these men so that they may see.” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened their eyes, and they saw that they were inside Samaria.  When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha, “Father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”  He answered, “No! Did you capture with your sword and your bow those whom you want to kill? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink; and let them go to their master.”  So he prepared for them a great feast; after they ate and drank, he sent them on their way, and they went to their master. And the Arameans no longer came raiding into the land of Israel.</p>

 <h3>Paul in Ephesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul passed through the interior regions and came to Ephesus, where he found some disciples.  He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”  Then he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They answered, “Into John’s baptism.”  Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”  On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied—  altogether there were about twelve of them.</p> <p>He entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly, and argued persuasively about the kingdom of God.  When some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he left them, taking the disciples with him, and argued daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.  This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</p>
