<h3 class="date">September 21, 2024</h3>
<h3 class="title">Sep 21 Saint Matthew Apostle And Evangelist</h3>


<div class="citation">Ephesians 2:19</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">You are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke thus to me while his hand was strong upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:  Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what it fears, or be in dread.  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.  He will become a sanctuary, a stone one strikes against; for both houses of Israel he will become a rock one stumbles over—a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  And many among them shall stumble; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.</p> <h3>Disciples of Isaiah</h3>
<p>Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples.  I will wait for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.  See, I and the children whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.  Now if people say to you, “Consult the ghosts and the familiar spirits that chirp and mutter; should not a people consult their gods, the dead on behalf of the living,  for teaching and for instruction?” surely, those who speak like this will have no dawn!  </p>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-2">Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.  I can testify that they have a zeal for God, but it is not enlightened.  For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness.  For Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</p> <h3>Salvation Is for All</h3>
<p>Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that “the person who does these things will live by them.”  But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)  “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say?</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The word is near you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on your lips and in your heart”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);  because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.  The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him.  For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</p> <p>But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him?  And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”  </p>
