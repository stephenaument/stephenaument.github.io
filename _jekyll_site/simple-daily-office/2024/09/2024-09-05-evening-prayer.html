<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Solomon’s Errors</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,  from the nations concerning which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to the Israelites, “You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you; for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods”; Solomon clung to these in love.  Among his wives were seven hundred princesses and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.  For when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not true to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> his God, as was the heart of his father David.  For Solomon followed Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.  So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and did not completely follow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, as his father David had done.  Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.  He did the same for all his foreign wives, who offered incense and sacrificed to their gods.</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,  and had commanded him concerning this matter, that he should not follow other gods; but he did not observe what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded.  Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Solomon, “Since this has been your mind and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.  Yet for the sake of your father David I will not do it in your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.  I will not, however, tear away the entire kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”</p>

 <h3>Barnabas and Saul Commissioned</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the ruler, and Saul.  While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”  Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.</p> <h3>The Apostles Preach in Cyprus</h3>
<p>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.  When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also to assist them.  When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they met a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus.  He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God.  But the magician Elymas (for that is the translation of his name) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.  But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him  and said, “You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?  And now listen—the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind for a while, unable to see the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he went about groping for someone to lead him by the hand.  When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
