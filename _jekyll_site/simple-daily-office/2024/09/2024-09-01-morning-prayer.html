<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Beatitudes</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him.  Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:</p> <p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p> <p>“Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</p> <p>“Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</p> <p>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</p> <p>“Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.</p> <p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</p> <p>“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.</p> <p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p> <p>“Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
