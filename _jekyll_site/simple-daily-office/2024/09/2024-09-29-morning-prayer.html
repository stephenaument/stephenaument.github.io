<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>God Has Spoken by His Son</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets,  but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds.  He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of God’s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,  having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p> <h3>The Son Is Superior to Angels</h3>
<p>For to which of the angels did God ever say,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are my Son;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>today I have begotten you”?</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">Or again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will be his Father,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and he will be my Son”?</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Let all God’s angels worship him.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Of the angels he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“He makes his angels winds,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his servants flames of fire.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But of the Son he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.</span><br>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;<br>therefore God, your God, has anointed you<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the heavens are the work of your hands;</span><br>they will perish, but you remain;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they will all wear out like clothing;</span><br>like a cloak you will roll them up,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and like clothing they will be changed.</span><br>But you are the same,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your years will never end.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But to which of the angels has he ever said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Sit at my right hand<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Are not all angels spirits in the divine service, sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?</p>

<h3>21. You are God <em class="latin_name">Te Deum Laudamus</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>You are God: we praise you;</p> <p>You are the Lord: we acclaim you;</p> <p>You are the eternal Father:</p> <p>All creation worships you.</p> <p>To you all angels, all the powers of heaven,</p> <p>Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise:</p> <p class="indent">Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,</p> <p class="indent">heaven and earth are full of your glory.</p> <p>The glorious company of apostles praise you.</p> <p>The noble fellowship of prophets praise you.</p> <p>The white-robed army of martyrs praise you.</p> <p>Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you;</p> <p class="indent">Father, of majesty unbounded,</p> <p class="indent">your true and only Son, worthy of all worship,</p> <p class="indent">and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.</p> <p>You, Christ, are the king of glory,</p> <p>the eternal Son of the Father.</p> <p>When you became man to set us free</p> <p>you did not shun the Virgin’s womb.</p> <p>You overcame the sting of death</p> <p>and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</p> <p>You are seated at God’s right hand in glory.</p> <p>We believe that you will come and be our judge.</p> <p class="indent">Come then, Lord, and help your people,</p> <p class="indent">bought with the price of your own blood,</p> <p class="indent">and bring us with your saints</p> <p class="indent">to glory everlasting.</p>

 <p class="indent2">and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
 <p class="indent2">was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
 <p class="indent">He descended to the dead.</p>
 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
