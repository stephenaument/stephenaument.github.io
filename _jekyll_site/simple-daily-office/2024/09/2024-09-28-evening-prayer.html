<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Athaliah Reigns over Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now when Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was dead, she set about to destroy all the royal family.  But Jehosheba, King Joram’s daughter, Ahaziah’s sister, took Joash son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s children who were about to be killed; she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus she hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not killed;  he remained with her six years, hidden in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, while Athaliah reigned over the land.</p> <h3>Jehoiada Anoints the Child Joash</h3>
<p>But in the seventh year Jehoiada summoned the captains of the Carites and of the guards and had them come to him in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then he showed them the king’s son.  He commanded them, “This is what you are to do: one-third of you, those who go off duty on the sabbath and guard the king’s house  (another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards), shall guard the palace;  and your two divisions that come on duty in force on the sabbath and guard the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>  shall surround the king, each with weapons in hand; and whoever approaches the ranks is to be killed. Be with the king in his comings and goings.”</p> <p>The captains did according to all that the priest Jehoiada commanded; each brought his men who were to go off duty on the sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the sabbath, and came to the priest Jehoiada.  The priest delivered to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David’s, which were in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>;  the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house, to guard the king on every side.  Then he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; they proclaimed him king, and anointed him; they clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”</p> <h3>Death of Athaliah</h3>
<p>When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to the people;  when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to custom, with the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!”  Then the priest Jehoiada commanded the captains who were set over the army, “Bring her out between the ranks, and kill with the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest said, “Let her not be killed in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  So they laid hands on her; she went through the horses’ entrance to the king’s house, and there she was put to death.</p> <p>Jehoiada made a covenant between the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and the king and people, that they should be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s people; also between the king and the people.  Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. The priest posted guards over the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  He took the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land; then they brought the king down from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, marching through the gate of the guards to the king’s house. He took his seat on the throne of the kings.  So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been killed with the sword at the king’s house.</p>

 <h3>Paul Goes to Macedonia and Greece</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples; and after encouraging them and saying farewell, he left for Macedonia.  When he had gone through those regions and had given the believers much encouragement, he came to Greece,  where he stayed for three months. He was about to set sail for Syria when a plot was made against him by the Jews, and so he decided to return through Macedonia.  He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, by Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, by Gaius from Derbe, and by Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.  They went ahead and were waiting for us in Troas;  but we sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we joined them in Troas, where we stayed for seven days.</p> <h3>Paul’s Farewell Visit to Troas</h3>
<p>On the first day of the week, when we met to break bread, Paul was holding a discussion with them; since he intended to leave the next day, he continued speaking until midnight.  There were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were meeting.  A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window, began to sink off into a deep sleep while Paul talked still longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell to the ground three floors below and was picked up dead.  But Paul went down, and bending over him took him in his arms, and said, “Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.”  Then Paul went upstairs, and after he had broken bread and eaten, he continued to converse with them until dawn; then he left.  Meanwhile they had taken the boy away alive and were not a little comforted.</p> <h3>The Voyage from Troas to Miletus</h3>
<p>We went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for he had made this arrangement, intending to go by land himself.  When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.  We sailed from there, and on the following day we arrived opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos, and the day after that we came to Miletus.  For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; he was eager to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</p>
