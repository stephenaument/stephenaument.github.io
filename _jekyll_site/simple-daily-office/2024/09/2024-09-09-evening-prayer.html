<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>A Man of God from Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">While Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer incense, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Bethel  and proclaimed against the altar by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “O altar, altar, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘A son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who offer incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.’”  He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken: ‘The altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.’”  When the king heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But the hand that he stretched out against him withered so that he could not draw it back to himself.  The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of God entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became as it was before.  Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and dine, and I will give you a gift.”  But the man of God said to the king, “If you give me half your kingdom, I will not go in with you; nor will I eat food or drink water in this place.  For thus I was commanded by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: You shall not eat food, or drink water, or return by the way that you came.”  So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he had come to Bethel.</p>

 <p>The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.  But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy; and blaspheming, they contradicted what was spoken by Paul.  Then both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you reject it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of eternal life, we are now turning to the Gentiles.  For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’”</span></p></div> <p>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord; and as many as had been destined for eternal life became believers.  Thus the word of the Lord spread throughout the region.  But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.  So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them, and went to Iconium.  And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>

Amen.
