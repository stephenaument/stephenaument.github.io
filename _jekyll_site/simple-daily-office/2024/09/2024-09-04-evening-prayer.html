<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>But Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.</p> <p>Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being on the altar that he built for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, offering incense before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. So he completed the house.</p> <h3>Solomon’s Commercial Activity</h3>
<p>King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.  Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, sailors who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.  They went to Ophir, and imported from there four hundred twenty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.</p> <h3>Visit of the Queen of Sheba</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon (fame due to the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>), she came to test him with hard questions.  She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.  Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.  When the queen of Sheba had observed all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,  the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his valets, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, there was no more spirit in her.</p> <p>So she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land of your accomplishments and of your wisdom,  but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. Not even half had been told me; your wisdom and prosperity far surpass the report that I had heard.  Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually attend you and hear your wisdom!  Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> loved Israel forever, he has made you king to execute justice and righteousness.”  Then she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones; never again did spices come in such quantity as that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</p> <p>Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a great quantity of almug wood and precious stones.  From the almug wood the king made supports for the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and for the king’s house, lyres also and harps for the singers; no such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.</p> <p>Meanwhile King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba every desire that she expressed, as well as what he gave her out of Solomon’s royal bounty. Then she returned to her own land, with her servants.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <p>When morning came, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.  When Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.</p> <h3>The Death of Herod</h3>
<p>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him in a body; and after winning over Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for a reconciliation, because their country depended on the king’s country for food.  On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat on the platform, and delivered a public address to them.  The people kept shouting, “The voice of a god, and not of a mortal!”  And immediately, because he had not given the glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.</p> <p>But the word of God continued to advance and gain adherents.  Then after completing their mission Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem and brought with them John, whose other name was Mark.</p>
