<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elijah’s Message to Ahab</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After many days the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Elijah, in the third year of the drought, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab; I will send rain on the earth.”  So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria.  Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Now Obadiah revered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> greatly;  when Jezebel was killing off the prophets of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Obadiah took a hundred prophets, hid them fifty to a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)  Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the wadis; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.”  So they divided the land between them to pass through it; Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.</p> <p>As Obadiah was on the way, Elijah met him; Obadiah recognized him, fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”  He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here.”  And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would hand your servant over to Ahab, to kill me?  As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom to which my lord has not sent to seek you; and when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he would require an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.  But now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here.’  As soon as I have gone from you, the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will carry you I know not where; so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have revered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> from my youth.  Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, how I hid a hundred of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s prophets fifty to a cave, and provided them with bread and water?  Yet now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord that Elijah is here’; he will surely kill me.”  Elijah said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.”  So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p> <p>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?”  He answered, “I have not troubled Israel; but you have, and your father’s house, because you have forsaken the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and followed the Baals.  Now therefore have all Israel assemble for me at Mount Carmel, with the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”</p>

 <h3>The Council at Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then certain individuals came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”  And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders.  So they were sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, they reported the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the believers.  When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.  But some believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and said, “It is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses.”</p> <p>The apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter.  After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “My brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that I should be the one through whom the Gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers.  And God, who knows the human heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;  and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us.  Now therefore why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?  On the contrary, we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.”</p>
