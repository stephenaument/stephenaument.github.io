<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Northern Tribes Secede</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.  When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.  And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,  “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke that he placed on us, and we will serve you.”  He said to them, “Go away for three days, then come again to me.” So the people went away.</p> <p>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the older men who had attended his father Solomon while he was still alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”  They answered him, “If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.”  But he disregarded the advice that the older men gave him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and now attended him.  He said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?”  The young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus you should say to this people who spoke to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you must lighten it for us’; thus you should say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.  Now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”</p> <p>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had said, “Come to me again the third day.”  The king answered the people harshly. He disregarded the advice that the older men had given him  and spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”  So the king did not listen to the people, because it was a turn of affairs brought about by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he might fulfill his word, which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.</p> <p>When all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What share do we have in David?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.</span><br>To your tents, O Israel!<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Look now to your own house, O David.”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">So Israel went away to their tents.  But Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah.  When King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam then hurriedly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.  So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</p> <h3>First Dynasty: Jeroboam Reigns over Israel</h3>
<p>When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed the house of David, except the tribe of Judah alone.</p>

 <p>“My brothers, you descendants of Abraham’s family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.  Because the residents of Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath, they fulfilled those words by condemning him.  Even though they found no cause for a sentence of death, they asked Pilate to have him killed.  When they had carried out everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.  But God raised him from the dead;  and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are now his witnesses to the people.  And we bring you the good news that what God promised to our ancestors  he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘You are my Son;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>today I have begotten you.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">As to his raising him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘I will give you the holy promises made to David.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore he has also said in another psalm,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘You will not let your Holy One experience corruption.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, died, was laid beside his ancestors, and experienced corruption;  but he whom God raised up experienced no corruption.  Let it be known to you therefore, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you;  by this Jesus everyone who believes is set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.  Beware, therefore, that what the prophets said does not happen to you:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Look, you scoffers!<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Be amazed and perish,</span><br>for in your days I am doing a work,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a work that you will never believe, even if someone tells you.’”</span></p></div> <p>As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath.  When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
