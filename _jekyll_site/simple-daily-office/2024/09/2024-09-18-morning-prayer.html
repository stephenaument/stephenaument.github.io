<div class="citation">Psalm 43:3</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Job Is Humbled and Satisfied</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Job answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I know that you can do all things,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</span><br>‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’<br>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</span><br>‘Hear, and I will speak;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I will question you, and you declare to me.’</span><br>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now my eye sees you;</span><br>therefore I despise myself,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and repent in dust and ashes.”</span></p></div> <h3>Job’s Friends Are Humiliated</h3>
<p>After the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken these words to Job, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.  Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has done.”  So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had told them; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> accepted Job’s prayer.</p> <h3>Job’s Fortunes Are Restored Twofold</h3>
<p>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before.  Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys.  He also had seven sons and three daughters.  He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.  In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.  After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children’s children, four generations.  And Job died, old and full of days.</p>

 <h3>Some Greeks Wish to See Jesus</h3>
<p>Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks.  They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”  Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.  Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.  Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.</p>
