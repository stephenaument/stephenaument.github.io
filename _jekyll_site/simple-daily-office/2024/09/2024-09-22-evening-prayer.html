<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elisha Raises the Shunammite’s Son</h3>
<p>One day Elisha was passing through Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to have a meal. So whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for a meal.  She said to her husband, “Look, I am sure that this man who regularly passes our way is a holy man of God.  Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that he can stay there whenever he comes to us.”</p> <p>One day when he came there, he went up to the chamber and lay down there.  He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite woman.” When he had called her, she stood before him.  He said to him, “Say to her, Since you have taken all this trouble for us, what may be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?” She answered, “I live among my own people.”  He said, “What then may be done for her?” Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”  He said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood at the door.  He said, “At this season, in due time, you shall embrace a son.” She replied, “No, my lord, O man of God; do not deceive your servant.”</p> <p>The woman conceived and bore a son at that season, in due time, as Elisha had declared to her.</p> <p>When the child was older, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.  He complained to his father, “Oh, my head, my head!” The father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”  He carried him and brought him to his mother; the child sat on her lap until noon, and he died.  She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door on him, and left.  Then she called to her husband, and said, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may quickly go to the man of God and come back again.”  He said, “Why go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath.” She said, “It will be all right.”  Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Urge the animal on; do not hold back for me unless I tell you.”  So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.</p>
<p>When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Look, there is the Shunammite woman;  run at once to meet her, and say to her, Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?” She answered, “It is all right.”  When she came to the man of God at the mountain, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has hidden it from me and has not told me.”  Then she said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not mislead me?”  He said to Gehazi, “Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, give no greeting, and if anyone greets you, do not answer; and lay my staff on the face of the child.”  Then the mother of the child said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave without you.” So he rose up and followed her.  Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. He came back to meet him and told him, “The child has not awakened.”</p> <p>When Elisha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.  So he went in and closed the door on the two of them, and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Then he got up on the bed and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and while he lay bent over him, the flesh of the child became warm.  He got down, walked once to and fro in the room, then got up again and bent over him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.  Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” So he called her. When she came to him, he said, “Take your son.”  She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took her son and left.</p>

 <h3>Hearing and Doing the Word</h3>
<p>You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger;  for your anger does not produce God’s righteousness.  Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls.</p> <p>But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.  For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror;  for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like.  But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act—they will be blessed in their doing.</p> <p>If any think they are religious, and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts, their religion is worthless.  Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>
