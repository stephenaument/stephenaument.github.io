<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> He got up, and ate and drank; then he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.  At that place he came to a cave, and spent the night there.</p>
<p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him, saying, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”  He answered, “I have been very zealous for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.”</p> <h3>Elijah Meets God at Horeb</h3>
<p>He said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is about to pass by.” Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not in the earthquake;  and after the earthquake a fire, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence.  When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”  He answered, “I have been very zealous for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life, to take it away.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Aram.  Also you shall anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah as prophet in your place.  Whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill; and whoever escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.  Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.”</p> <h3>Elisha Becomes Elijah’s Disciple</h3>
<p>So he set out from there, and found Elisha son of Shaphat, who was plowing. There were twelve yoke of oxen ahead of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle over him.  He left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” Then Elijah said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”  He returned from following him, took the yoke of oxen, and slaughtered them; using the equipment from the oxen, he boiled their flesh, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out and followed Elijah, and became his servant.</p>
