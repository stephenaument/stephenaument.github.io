<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication</h3>
<p>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands to heaven.  He said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love for your servants who walk before you with all their heart,  the covenant that you kept for your servant my father David as you declared to him; you promised with your mouth and have this day fulfilled with your hand.  Therefore, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of Israel, keep for your servant my father David that which you promised him, saying, ‘There shall never fail you a successor before me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children look to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.’  Therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised to your servant my father David.</p> <p>“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, much less this house that I have built!  Regard your servant’s prayer and his plea, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, heeding the cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you today;  that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may heed the prayer that your servant prays toward this place.  Hear the plea of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place; O hear in heaven your dwelling place; heed and forgive.</p> <p>“If someone sins against a neighbor and is given an oath to swear, and comes and swears before your altar in this house,  then hear in heaven, and act, and judge your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing their conduct on their own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding them according to their righteousness.</p> <p>“When your people Israel, having sinned against you, are defeated before an enemy but turn again to you, confess your name, pray and plead with you in this house,  then hear in heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land that you gave to their ancestors.</p> <p>“When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and then they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin, because you punish them,  then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and grant rain on your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.</p> <p>“If there is famine in the land, if there is plague, blight, mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in any of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is;  whatever prayer, whatever plea there is from any individual or from all your people Israel, all knowing the afflictions of their own hearts so that they stretch out their hands toward this house;  then hear in heaven your dwelling place, forgive, act, and render to all whose hearts you know—according to all their ways, for only you know what is in every human heart—  so that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our ancestors.</p>

 <h3>The Scroll and the Lamb</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals;  and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”  And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.  And I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.  Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p> <p>Then I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.  He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.  When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.  They sing a new song:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are worthy to take the scroll<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and to open its seals,</span><br>for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for God<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>saints from every tribe and language and people and nation;</span><br>you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and they will reign on earth.”</span></p></div> <p>Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,  singing with full voice,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered<br>to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might<br>and honor and glory and blessing!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, singing,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb<br>be blessing and honor and glory and might<br>forever and ever!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the elders fell down and worshiped.</p>
