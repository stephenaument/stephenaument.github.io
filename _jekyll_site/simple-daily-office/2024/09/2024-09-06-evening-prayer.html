<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jeroboam’s Rebellion</h3>
<p>Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, rebelled against the king.  The following was the reason he rebelled against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.  The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.  About that time, when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Ahijah had clothed himself with a new garment. The two of them were alone in the open country  when Ahijah laid hold of the new garment he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.  He then said to Jeroboam: Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, “See, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes.  One tribe will remain his, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.  This is because he has forsaken me, worshiped Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as his father David did.  Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom away from him but will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of my servant David whom I chose and who did keep my commandments and my statutes;  but I will take the kingdom away from his son and give it to you—that is, the ten tribes.  Yet to his son I will give one tribe, so that my servant David may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.  I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires; you shall be king over Israel.  If you will listen to all that I command you, walk in my ways, and do what is right in my sight by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you an enduring house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.  For this reason I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever.”  Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam promptly fled to Egypt, to King Shishak of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p> <h3>Death of Solomon</h3>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did as well as his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?  The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.  Solomon slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.</p>

 <h3>Paul and Barnabas in Antioch of Pisidia</h3>
<p>Then Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem;  but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.  After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it.”  So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak:</p>
<p>“You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen.  The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.  For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.  After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance  for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.  Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.  When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’  Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised;  before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.  And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.’</p>
