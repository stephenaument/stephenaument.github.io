<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>“Likewise when foreigners, who are not of your people Israel, come from a distant land because of your great name, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house,  may you hear from heaven your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigners ask of you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that your name has been invoked on this house that I have built.</p> <p>“If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,  then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.</p> <p>“If they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near;  then if they come to their senses in the land to which they have been taken captive, and repent, and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, and have done wrong; we have acted wickedly’;  if they repent with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity, to which they were taken captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their ancestors, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,  then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you.  Now, O my God, let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to prayer from this place.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Now rise up, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, and go to your resting place,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you and the ark of your might.</span><br>Let your priests, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, be clothed with salvation,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and let your faithful rejoice in your goodness.</span><br>O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, do not reject your anointed one.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Remember your steadfast love for your servant David.”</span></p></div> <h3>Solomon Dedicates the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When Solomon had ended his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> filled the temple.  The priests could not enter the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> filled the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house.  When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> on the temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and worshiped and gave thanks to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For he is good,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for his steadfast love endures forever.”</span></p></div> <p>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  King Solomon offered as a sacrifice twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.  The priests stood at their posts; the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that King David had made for giving thanks to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>—for his steadfast love endures forever—whenever David offered praises by their ministry. Opposite them the priests sounded trumpets; and all Israel stood.</p> <p>Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the offerings of well-being because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat parts.</p> </div>

 <h3>The Church in Antioch</h3>
<p>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews.  But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.  The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.  News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion;  for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord.  Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,  and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”</p> <p>At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.  One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius.  The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea;  this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</p>
