<h3 class="date">September 28, 2024</h3>
<h3 class="title">Saturday In The Week Of Proper 20</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p class="chapter-1">The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in the days of King Jeroboam son of Joash of Israel.</p> <h3>The Family of Hosea</h3>
<p>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> first spoke through Hosea, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.</p> <p>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Name him Jezreel; for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.  On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”</p> <p>She conceived again and bore a daughter. Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have pity on the house of Israel or forgive them.  But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God; I will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by war, or by horses, or by horsemen.”</p> <p>When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not my people and I am not your God.”</p> <h3>The Restoration of Israel</h3>
<p> Yet the number of the people of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which can be neither measured nor numbered; and in the place where it was said to them, “You are not my people,” it shall be said to them, “Children of the living God.”  The people of Judah and the people of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint for themselves one head; and they shall take possession of the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</p> <p class="chapter-1"> Say to your brother, Ammi, and to your sister, Ruhamah.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Healings at Simon’s House</h3>
<p>After leaving the synagogue he entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked him about her.  Then he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them.</p> <p>As the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various kinds of diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on each of them and cured them.  Demons also came out of many, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah.</p> <h3>Jesus Preaches in the Synagogues</h3>
<p>At daybreak he departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowds were looking for him; and when they reached him, they wanted to prevent him from leaving them.  But he said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.”  So he continued proclaiming the message in the synagogues of Judea.</p>
