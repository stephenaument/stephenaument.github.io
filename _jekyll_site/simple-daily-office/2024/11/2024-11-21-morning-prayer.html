<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Mal 2:1-16</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-1">And now, O priests, this command is for you.  If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, then I will send the curse on you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.  I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.</p> <p>Know, then, that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may hold, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  My covenant with him was a covenant of life and well-being, which I gave him; this called for reverence, and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.  True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in integrity and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.  For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in your instruction.</p> <h3>The Covenant Profaned by Judah</h3>
<p>Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?  Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.  May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> cut off from the tents of Jacob anyone who does this—any to witness or answer, or to bring an offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.</p> <p>And this you do as well: You cover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor at your hand.  You ask, “Why does he not?” Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was a witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.  Did not one God make her? Both flesh and spirit are his. And what does the one God desire? Godly offspring. So look to yourselves, and do not let anyone be faithless to the wife of his youth.  For I hate divorce, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, and covering one’s garment with violence, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless.</p>

 <h3>The Coming of the Kingdom</h3>
<p>Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, and he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed;  nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ For, in fact, the kingdom of God is among you.”</p> <p>Then he said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.  They will say to you, ‘Look there!’ or ‘Look here!’ Do not go, do not set off in pursuit.  For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.  But first he must endure much suffering and be rejected by this generation.  Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man.  They were eating and drinking, and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all of them.  Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,  but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed all of them  —it will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.  On that day, anyone on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must not turn back.  Remember Lot’s wife.  Those who try to make their life secure will lose it, but those who lose their life will keep it.  I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.  There will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other left.”  Then they asked him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.”</p>
