<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Battle at Emmaus</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now Gorgias took five thousand infantry and one thousand picked cavalry, and this division moved out by night  to fall upon the camp of the Jews and attack them suddenly. Men from the citadel were his guides.  But Judas heard of it, and he and his warriors moved out to attack the king’s force in Emmaus  while the division was still absent from the camp.  When Gorgias entered the camp of Judas by night, he found no one there, so he looked for them in the hills, because he said, “These men are running away from us.”</p> <p>At daybreak Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men, but they did not have armor and swords such as they desired.  And they saw the camp of the Gentiles, strong and fortified, with cavalry all around it; and these men were trained in war.  But Judas said to those who were with him, “Do not fear their numbers or be afraid when they charge.  Remember how our ancestors were saved at the Red Sea, when Pharaoh with his forces pursued them.  And now, let us cry to Heaven, to see whether he will favor us and remember his covenant with our ancestors and crush this army before us today.  Then all the Gentiles will know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel.”</p> <p>When the foreigners looked up and saw them coming against them,  they went out from their camp to battle. Then the men with Judas blew their trumpets  and engaged in battle. The Gentiles were crushed, and fled into the plain,  and all those in the rear fell by the sword. They pursued them to Gazara, and to the plains of Idumea, and to Azotus and Jamnia; and three thousand of them fell.  Then Judas and his force turned back from pursuing them,  and he said to the people, “Do not be greedy for plunder, for there is a battle before us;  Gorgias and his force are near us in the hills. But stand now against our enemies and fight them, and afterward seize the plunder boldly.”</p> <p>Just as Judas was finishing this speech, a detachment appeared, coming out of the hills.  They saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews were burning the camp, for the smoke that was seen showed what had happened.  When they perceived this, they were greatly frightened, and when they also saw the army of Judas drawn up in the plain for battle,  they all fled into the land of the Philistines.  Then Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they seized a great amount of gold and silver, and cloth dyed blue and sea purple, and great riches.  On their return they sang hymns and praises to Heaven—“For he is good, for his mercy endures forever.”  Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.</p>

 <h3>Boasting about Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money.”  Yet you do not even know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.  Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wishes, we will live and do this or that.”  As it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.  Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, commits sin.</p> <h3>Warning to Rich Oppressors</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Come now, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you.  Your riches have rotted, and your clothes are moth-eaten.  Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you, and it will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the last days.  Listen! The wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.  You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.  You have condemned and murdered the righteous one, who does not resist you.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
