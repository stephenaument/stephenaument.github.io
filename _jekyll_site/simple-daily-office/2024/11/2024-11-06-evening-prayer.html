<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Reforms of Nehemiah</h3>
<p>Now before this, the priest Eliashib, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was related to Tobiah,  prepared for Tobiah a large room where they had previously put the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.  While this was taking place I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes of Babylon I went to the king. After some time I asked leave of the king  and returned to Jerusalem. I then discovered the wrong that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah, preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.  And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the room.  Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers, and I brought back the vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.</p> <p>I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them; so that the Levites and the singers, who had conducted the service, had gone back to their fields.  So I remonstrated with the officials and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their stations.  Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.  And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses the priest Shelemiah, the scribe Zadok, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan son of Zaccur son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful; and their duty was to distribute to their associates.  Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.</p> <h3>Sabbath Reforms Begun</h3>
<p>In those days I saw in Judah people treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys; and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them at that time against selling food.  Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of merchandise and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.  Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day?  Did not your ancestors act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the sabbath.”</p> <p>When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates, to prevent any burden from being brought in on the sabbath day.  Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.  But I warned them and said to them, “Why do you spend the night in front of the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.  And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.</p>

 <h3>The Bowls of God’s Wrath</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”</p> <p>So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth, and a foul and painful sore came on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image.</p> <p>The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing in the sea died.</p> <p>The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.  And I heard the angel of the waters say,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are just, O Holy One, who are and were,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for you have judged these things;</span><br>because they shed the blood of saints and prophets,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you have given them blood to drink.</span><br>It is what they deserve!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And I heard the altar respond,</p>
