<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Installation of Gentile Cults</h3>
<p>Then the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people,  and that all should give up their particular customs.  All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath.  And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah; he directed them to follow customs strange to the land,  to forbid burnt offerings and sacrifices and drink offerings in the sanctuary, to profane sabbaths and festivals,  to defile the sanctuary and the priests,  to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and other unclean animals,  and to leave their sons uncircumcised. They were to make themselves abominable by everything unclean and profane,  so that they would forget the law and change all the ordinances.  He added, “And whoever does not obey the command of the king shall die.”</p> <p>In such words he wrote to his whole kingdom. He appointed inspectors over all the people and commanded the towns of Judah to offer sacrifice, town by town.  Many of the people, everyone who forsook the law, joined them, and they did evil in the land;  they drove Israel into hiding in every place of refuge they had.</p> <p>Now on the fifteenth day of Chislev, in the one hundred forty-fifth year, they erected a desolating sacrilege on the altar of burnt offering. They also built altars in the surrounding towns of Judah,  and offered incense at the doors of the houses and in the streets.  The books of the law that they found they tore to pieces and burned with fire.  Anyone found possessing the book of the covenant, or anyone who adhered to the law, was condemned to death by decree of the king.  They kept using violence against Israel, against those who were found month after month in the towns.  On the twenty-fifth day of the month they offered sacrifice on the altar that was on top of the altar of burnt offering.  According to the decree, they put to death the women who had their children circumcised,  and their families and those who circumcised them; and they hung the infants from their mothers’ necks.</p> <p>But many in Israel stood firm and were resolved in their hearts not to eat unclean food.  They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food or to profane the holy covenant; and they did die.  </p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> Do not be deceived, my beloved.</p> <p>Every generous act of giving, with every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.  In fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</p> <h3>Hearing and Doing the Word</h3>
<p>You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger;  for your anger does not produce God’s righteousness.  Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls.</p> <p>But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.  For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror;  for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like.  But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act—they will be blessed in their doing.</p> <p>If any think they are religious, and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts, their religion is worthless.  Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>
