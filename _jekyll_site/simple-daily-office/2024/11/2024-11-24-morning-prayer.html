<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When they had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,  saying to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.  If anyone says anything to you, just say this, ‘The Lord needs them.’ And he will send them immediately.”  This took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet, saying,</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Tell the daughter of Zion,<br>Look, your king is coming to you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>humble, and mounted on a donkey,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them;  they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them.  A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.  The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hosanna to the Son of David!<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!</span><br>Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, “Who is this?”  The crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.”</p> <h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3>
<p>Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.  He said to them, “It is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but you are making it a den of robbers.”</span></p></div>
