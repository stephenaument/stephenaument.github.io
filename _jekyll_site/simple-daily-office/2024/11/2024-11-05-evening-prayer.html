<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Dedication of the City Wall</h3>
<p>Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with rejoicing, with thanksgivings and with singing, with cymbals, harps, and lyres.  The companies of the singers gathered together from the circuit around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;  also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem.  And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.</p> <p>Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession. One went to the right on the wall to the Dung Gate;  </p>

<p> and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang with Jezrahiah as their leader.  They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. The joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.</p> <h3>Temple Responsibilities</h3>
<p>On that day men were appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the law for the priests and for the Levites from the fields belonging to the towns; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered.  They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did the singers and the gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon.  For in the days of David and Asaph long ago there was a leader of the singers, and there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.  In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers. They set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the descendants of Aaron.</p>

 <h3>Reaping the Earth’s Harvest</h3>
<p>Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like the Son of Man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand!  Another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “Use your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”  So the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p> <p>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.  Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.”  So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and he threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.  And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse’s bridle, for a distance of about two hundred miles.</p> <h3>The Angels with the Seven Last Plagues</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then I saw another portent in heaven, great and amazing: seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is ended.</p> <p>And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.  And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Great and amazing are your deeds,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Lord God the Almighty!</span><br>Just and true are your ways,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>King of the nations!</span><br>Lord, who will not fear<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and glorify your name?</span><br>For you alone are holy.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>All nations will come</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and worship before you,</span><br>for your judgments have been revealed.”</p></div> <p class="top-1">After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened,  and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright linen, with golden sashes across their chests.  Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever;  and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
