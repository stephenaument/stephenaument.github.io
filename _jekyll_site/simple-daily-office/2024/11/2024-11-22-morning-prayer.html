<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Coming Messenger</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight—indeed, he is coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears?</p>
<p>For he is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap;  he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in righteousness.  Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> as in the days of old and as in former years.</p> <p>Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be swift to bear witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired workers in their wages, the widow and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the alien, and do not fear me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.</p> <p>For I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, have not perished.  Ever since the days of your ancestors you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts. But you say, “How shall we return?”</p> <h3>Do Not Rob God</h3>
<p>Will anyone rob God? Yet you are robbing me! But you say, “How are we robbing you?” In your tithes and offerings!  You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me—the whole nation of you!  Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in my house, and thus put me to the test, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts; see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an overflowing blessing.  I will rebuke the locust for you, so that it will not destroy the produce of your soil; and your vine in the field shall not be barren, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  Then all nations will count you happy, for you will be a land of delight, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Widow and the Unjust Judge</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray always and not to lose heart.  He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor had respect for people.  In that city there was a widow who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’  For a while he refused; but later he said to himself, ‘Though I have no fear of God and no respect for anyone,  yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she may not wear me out by continually coming.’”  And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says.  And will not God grant justice to his chosen ones who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long in helping them?  I tell you, he will quickly grant justice to them. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</p>
