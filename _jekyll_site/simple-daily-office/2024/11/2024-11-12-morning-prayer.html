<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <p>Come, let us sing to the Lord; *</p>

  <p class="indent">and a great King above all gods.</p>
  <p>In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
  <p>The sea is his, for he made it, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and his hands have molded the dry land.</p>
  <p class="space">Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
  <p>For he is our God,</p>
  <p>and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *</p>
  <p class="indent">Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!</p>

 <h3>The Cost of Discipleship</h3>
<p>Now large crowds were traveling with him; and he turned and said to them,  “Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.  Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.  For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it?  Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him,  saying, ‘This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.’  Or what king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who comes against him with twenty thousand?  If he cannot, then, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for the terms of peace.  So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions.</p> <h3>About Salt</h3>
<p>“Salt is good; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored?  It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; they throw it away. Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>O God, whose blessed Son came into the world that he might<br>destroy the works of the devil and make us children of God<br>and heirs of eternal life: Grant that, having this hope, we may<br>purify ourselves as he is pure; that, when he comes again<br>with power and great glory, we may be made like him in his<br>eternal and glorious kingdom; where he lives and reigns with<br>you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Peace</h3>
<p>O God, the author of peace and lover of concord, to know you is eternal life and to serve you is perfect freedom: Defend us, your humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that we, surely trusting in your defense, may not fear the power of any adversaries; through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.
</p>


<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>

but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>

And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>

be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
