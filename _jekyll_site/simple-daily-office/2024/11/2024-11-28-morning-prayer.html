<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p class="chapter-2">When you have come into the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it,  you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his name.  You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, “Today I declare to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God that I have come into the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> swore to our ancestors to give us.”  When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God,  you shall make this response before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God: “A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous.

The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders;  and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.  So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, have given me.” You shall set it down before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and bow down before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given to you and to your house.</p>

<p> Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.  Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”  Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”  Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”  So they said to him, “What sign are you going to give us then, so that we may see it and believe you? What work are you performing?  Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”  Then Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.  For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”  They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”</p> <p>Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.  </p>
