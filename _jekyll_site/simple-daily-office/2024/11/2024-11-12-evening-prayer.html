<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>“Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against you and cast your law behind their backs and killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you, and they committed great blasphemies.  Therefore you gave them into the hands of their enemies, who made them suffer. Then in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them saviors who saved them from the hands of their enemies.  But after they had rest, they again did evil before you, and you abandoned them to the hands of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, and many times you rescued them according to your mercies.  And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, by the observance of which a person shall live. They turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck and would not obey.  Many years you were patient with them, and warned them by your spirit through your prophets; yet they would not listen. Therefore you handed them over to the peoples of the lands.  Nevertheless, in your great mercies you did not make an end of them or forsake them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.</p> <p>“Now therefore, our God—the great and mighty and awesome God, keeping covenant and steadfast love—do not treat lightly all the hardship that has come upon us, upon our kings, our officials, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria until today.  You have been just in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully and we have acted wickedly;  our kings, our officials, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept your law or heeded the commandments and the warnings that you gave them.  Even in their own kingdom, and in the great goodness you bestowed on them, and in the large and rich land that you set before them, they did not serve you and did not turn from their wicked works.  Here we are, slaves to this day—slaves in the land that you gave to our ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts.  Its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins; they have power also over our bodies and over our livestock at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.”</p> <h3>Those Who Signed the Covenant</h3>
<p> Because of all this we make a firm agreement in writing, and on that sealed document are inscribed the names of our officials, our Levites, and our priests.</p>

 <h3>The Rejoicing in Heaven</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hallelujah!<br>Salvation and glory and power to our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for his judgments are true and just;</span><br>he has judged the great whore<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>who corrupted the earth with her fornication,</span><br>and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Once more they said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hallelujah!<br>The smoke goes up from her forever and ever.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Amen. Hallelujah!”</p></div> <p>And from the throne came a voice saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Praise our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>all you his servants,</span><br>and all who fear him,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>small and great.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying out,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hallelujah!<br>For the Lord our God<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the Almighty reigns.</span><br>Let us rejoice and exult<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and give him the glory,</span><br>for the marriage of the Lamb has come,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his bride has made herself ready;</span><br>to her it has been granted to be clothed<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>with fine linen, bright and pure”—</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.</p> <p>And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are true words of God.”  Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your comrades who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</p>
