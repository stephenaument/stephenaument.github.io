<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Mattathias and His Sons</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In those days Mattathias son of John son of Simeon, a priest of the family of Joarib, moved from Jerusalem and settled in Modein.  He had five sons, John surnamed Gaddi,  Simon called Thassi,  Judas called Maccabeus,  Eleazar called Avaran, and Jonathan called Apphus.  He saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and Jerusalem,  and said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Alas! Why was I born to see this,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the ruin of my people, the ruin of the holy city,</span><br>and to live there when it was given over to the enemy,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the sanctuary given over to aliens?</span><br>Her temple has become like a person without honor;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>her glorious vessels have been carried into exile.</span><br>Her infants have been killed in her streets,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>her youths by the sword of the foe.</span><br>What nation has not inherited her palaces<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and has not seized her spoils?</span><br>All her adornment has been taken away;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>no longer free, she has become a slave.</span><br>And see, our holy place, our beauty,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and our glory have been laid waste;</span><br>the Gentiles have profaned them.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Why should we live any longer?”</span></p></div> <p>Then Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly.</p> <h3>Pagan Worship Refused</h3>
<p>The king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town of Modein to make them offer sacrifice.  Many from Israel came to them; and Mattathias and his sons were assembled.  Then the king’s officers spoke to Mattathias as follows: “You are a leader, honored and great in this town, and supported by sons and brothers.  Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the Gentiles and the people of Judah and those that are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the Friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”</p> <p>But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: “Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him, and have chosen to obey his commandments, every one of them abandoning the religion of their ancestors,  I and my sons and my brothers will continue to live by the covenant of our ancestors.  Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances.  We will not obey the king’s words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left.”</p> <p>When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein, according to the king’s command.  When Mattathias saw it, he burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him on the altar.  At the same time he killed the king’s officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar.  Thus he burned with zeal for the law, just as Phinehas did against Zimri son of Salu.</p> <p>Then Mattathias cried out in the town with a loud voice, saying: “Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!”  Then he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the town.</p>

 <h3>Warning against Partiality</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">My brothers and sisters, do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ?  For if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in,  and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say, “Have a seat here, please,” while to the one who is poor you say, “Stand there,” or, “Sit at my feet,”  have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?  Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters. Has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?  But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?  Is it not they who blaspheme the excellent name that was invoked over you?</p> <p>You do well if you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.  For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.  For the one who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.  So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.  For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</p>
