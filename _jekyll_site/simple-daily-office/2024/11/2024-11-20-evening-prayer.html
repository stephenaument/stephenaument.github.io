<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Now Judas and his brothers saw that misfortunes had increased and that the forces were encamped in their territory. They also learned what the king had commanded to do to the people to cause their final destruction.  But they said to one another, “Let us restore the ruins of our people, and fight for our people and the sanctuary.”  So the congregation assembled to be ready for battle, and to pray and ask for mercy and compassion.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Jerusalem was uninhabited like a wilderness;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>not one of her children went in or out.</span><br>The sanctuary was trampled down,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and aliens held the citadel;</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>it was a lodging place for the Gentiles.</span><br>Joy was taken from Jacob;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the flute and the harp ceased to play.</span></p></div> <p>Then they gathered together and went to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem, because Israel formerly had a place of prayer in Mizpah.  They fasted that day, put on sackcloth and sprinkled ashes on their heads, and tore their clothes.  And they opened the book of the law to inquire into those matters about which the Gentiles consulted the likenesses of their gods.  They also brought the vestments of the priesthood and the first fruits and the tithes, and they stirred up the nazirites who had completed their days;  and they cried aloud to Heaven, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What shall we do with these?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Where shall we take them?</span><br>Your sanctuary is trampled down and profaned,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your priests mourn in humiliation.</span><br>Here the Gentiles are assembled against us to destroy us;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you know what they plot against us.</span><br>How will we be able to withstand them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>if you do not help us?”</span></p></div> <p>Then they sounded the trumpets and gave a loud shout.  After this Judas appointed leaders of the people, in charge of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens.  Those who were building houses, or were about to be married, or were planting a vineyard, or were fainthearted, he told to go home again, according to the law.  Then the army marched out and encamped to the south of Emmaus.</p> <p>And Judas said, “Arm yourselves and be courageous. Be ready early in the morning to fight with these Gentiles who have assembled against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.  It is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary.  But as his will in heaven may be, so shall he do.”</p>

 <h3>Two Kinds of Wisdom</h3>
<p>Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom.  But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth.  Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish.  For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind.  But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.  And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</p> <h3>Friendship with the World</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Those conflicts and disputes among you, where do they come from? Do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you?  You want something and do not have it; so you commit murder. And you covet something and cannot obtain it; so you engage in disputes and conflicts. You do not have, because you do not ask.  You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, in order to spend what you get on your pleasures.  Adulterers! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.  Or do you suppose that it is for nothing that the scripture says, “God yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”?  But he gives all the more grace; therefore it says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“God opposes the proud,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but gives grace to the humble.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  Lament and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p> <h3>Warning against Judging Another</h3>
<p>Do not speak evil against one another, brothers and sisters. Whoever speaks evil against another or judges another, speaks evil against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.  There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. So who, then, are you to judge your neighbor?</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
