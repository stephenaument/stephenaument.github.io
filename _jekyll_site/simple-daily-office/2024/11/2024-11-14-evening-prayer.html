<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Alexander the Great</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came from the land of Kittim, had defeated King Darius of the Persians and the Medes, he succeeded him as king. (He had previously become king of Greece.)  He fought many battles, conquered strongholds, and put to death the kings of the earth.  He advanced to the ends of the earth, and plundered many nations. When the earth became quiet before him, he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up.  He gathered a very strong army and ruled over countries, nations, and princes, and they became tributary to him.</p> <p>After this he fell sick and perceived that he was dying.  So he summoned his most honored officers, who had been brought up with him from youth, and divided his kingdom among them while he was still alive.  And after Alexander had reigned twelve years, he died.</p> <p>Then his officers began to rule, each in his own place.  They all put on crowns after his death, and so did their descendants after them for many years; and they caused many evils on the earth.</p> <h3>Antiochus Epiphanes and Renegade Jews</h3>
<p>From them came forth a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of King Antiochus; he had been a hostage in Rome. He began to reign in the one hundred thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.</p> <p>In those days certain renegades came out from Israel and misled many, saying, “Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles around us, for since we separated from them many disasters have come upon us.”  This proposal pleased them,  and some of the people eagerly went to the king, who authorized them to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles.  So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, according to Gentile custom,  and removed the marks of circumcision, and abandoned the holy covenant. They joined with the Gentiles and sold themselves to do evil.</p> <h3>Antiochus in Egypt</h3>
<p>When Antiochus saw that his kingdom was established, he determined to become king of the land of Egypt, in order that he might reign over both kingdoms.  So he invaded Egypt with a strong force, with chariots and elephants and cavalry and with a large fleet.  He engaged King Ptolemy of Egypt in battle, and Ptolemy turned and fled before him, and many were wounded and fell.  They captured the fortified cities in the land of Egypt, and he plundered the land of Egypt.</p> <h3>Persecution of the Jews</h3>
<p>After subduing Egypt, Antiochus returned in the one hundred forty-third year. He went up against Israel and came to Jerusalem with a strong force.  He arrogantly entered the sanctuary and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils.  He took also the table for the bread of the Presence, the cups for drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the curtain, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple; he stripped it all off.  He took the silver and the gold, and the costly vessels; he took also the hidden treasures that he found.  Taking them all, he went into his own land.</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">He shed much blood,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and spoke with great arrogance.</span><br>Israel mourned deeply in every community,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>rulers and elders groaned,</span><br>young women and young men became faint,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the beauty of the women faded.</span><br>Every bridegroom took up the lament;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>she who sat in the bridal chamber was mourning.</span><br>Even the land trembled for its inhabitants,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.</span></p></div>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion:</p>
<p>Greetings.</p> <h3>Faith and Wisdom</h3>
<p>My brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kind, consider it nothing but joy,  because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance;  and let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing.</p> <p>If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you.  But ask in faith, never doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind;  for the doubter, being double-minded and unstable in every way, must not expect to receive anything from the Lord.</p> <h3>Poverty and Riches</h3>
<p>Let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up,  and the rich in being brought low, because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field.  For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. It is the same way with the rich; in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away.</p> <h3>Trial and Temptation</h3>
<p>Blessed is anyone who endures temptation. Such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.  No one, when tempted, should say, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one.  But one is tempted by one’s own desire, being lured and enticed by it;  then, when that desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and that sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.  </p>
