<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>At that time many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to live there,  they, their sons, their wives, and their livestock, because troubles pressed heavily upon them.  And it was reported to the king’s officers, and to the troops in Jerusalem the city of David, that those who had rejected the king’s command had gone down to the hiding places in the wilderness.  Many pursued them, and overtook them; they encamped opposite them and prepared for battle against them on the sabbath day.  They said to them, “Enough of this! Come out and do what the king commands, and you will live.”  But they said, “We will not come out, nor will we do what the king commands and so profane the sabbath day.”  Then the enemy quickly attacked them.  But they did not answer them or hurl a stone at them or block up their hiding places,  for they said, “Let us all die in our innocence; heaven and earth testify for us that you are killing us unjustly.”  So they attacked them on the sabbath, and they died, with their wives and children and livestock, to the number of a thousand persons.</p> <p>When Mattathias and his friends learned of it, they mourned for them deeply.  And all said to their neighbors: “If we all do as our kindred have done and refuse to fight with the Gentiles for our lives and for our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from the earth.”  So they made this decision that day: “Let us fight against anyone who comes to attack us on the sabbath day; let us not all die as our kindred died in their hiding places.”</p> <h3>Counter-Attack</h3>
<p>Then there united with them a company of Hasideans, mighty warriors of Israel, all who offered themselves willingly for the law.  And all who became fugitives to escape their troubles joined them and reinforced them.  </p>

 <h3>The Last Words of Mattathias</h3>
<p>Now the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons: “Arrogance and scorn have now become strong; it is a time of ruin and furious anger.  Now, my children, show zeal for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our ancestors.</p>

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">

<p> Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,  I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.  Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will reveal to you.  Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.</p> <p>Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live according to the example you have in us.  For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears.  Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things.  But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.  He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself.  Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
