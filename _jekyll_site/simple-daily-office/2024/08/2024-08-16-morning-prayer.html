<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p class="first-line-none"> And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.</p> <h3>Samson Defeats the Philistines</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After a while, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing along a kid. He said, “I want to go into my wife’s room.” But her father would not allow him to go in.  Her father said, “I was sure that you had rejected her; so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister prettier than she? Why not take her instead?”  Samson said to them, “This time, when I do mischief to the Philistines, I will be without blame.”  So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took some torches; and he turned the foxes tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails.  When he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.  Then the Philistines asked, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken Samson’s wife and given her to his companion.” So the Philistines came up, and burned her and her father.  Samson said to them, “If this is what you do, I swear I will not stop until I have taken revenge on you.”  He struck them down hip and thigh with great slaughter; and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</p> <p>Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah, and made a raid on Lehi.  The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.”  Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and they said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then have you done to us?” He replied, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”  They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, so that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” Samson answered them, “Swear to me that you yourselves will not attack me.”  They said to him, “No, we will only bind you and give you into their hands; we will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</p> <p>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> rushed on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.  Then he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached down and took it, and with it he killed a thousand men.  And Samson said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“With the jawbone of a donkey,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>heaps upon heaps,</span><br>with the jawbone of a donkey<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I have slain a thousand men.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.</p> <p>By then he was very thirsty, and he called on the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying, “You have granted this great victory by the hand of your servant. Am I now to die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”  So God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came from it. When he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore it was named En-hakkore, which is at Lehi to this day.  And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Jesus Returns to Galilee</h3>
<p>When the two days were over, he went from that place to Galilee  (for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophet’s own country).  When he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival; for they too had gone to the festival.</p> <h3>Jesus Heals an Official’s Son</h3>
<p>Then he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in Capernaum.  When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.  Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.”  The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my little boy dies.”  Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way.  As he was going down, his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive.  So he asked them the hour when he began to recover, and they said to him, “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.”  The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he himself believed, along with his whole household.  Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.</p>
