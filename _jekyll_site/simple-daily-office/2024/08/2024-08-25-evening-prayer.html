<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David’s Census of Israel and Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Again the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go, count the people of Israel and Judah.”  So the king said to Joab and the commanders of the army, who were with him, “Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and take a census of the people, so that I may know how many there are.”  </p>

 <h3>Judgment on David’s Sin</h3>
<p>But afterward, David was stricken to the heart because he had numbered the people. David said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I pray you, take away the guilt of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”  When David rose in the morning, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,  “Go and say to David: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Three things I offer you; choose one of them, and I will do it to you.”  So Gad came to David and told him; he asked him, “Shall three years of famine come to you on your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to the one who sent me.”  Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into human hands.”</p> <p>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent a pestilence on Israel from that morning until the appointed time; and seventy thousand of the people died, from Dan to Beer-sheba.  </p>

 <h3>The Heavenly Worship</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After this I looked, and there in heaven a door stood open! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”  At once I was in the spirit, and there in heaven stood a throne, with one seated on the throne!  And the one seated there looks like jasper and carnelian, and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an emerald.  Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones are twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads.  Coming from the throne are flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God;  and in front of the throne there is something like a sea of glass, like crystal.</p>
<p>Around the throne, and on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind:  the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with a face like a human face, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.  And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and inside. Day and night without ceasing they sing,</p>
