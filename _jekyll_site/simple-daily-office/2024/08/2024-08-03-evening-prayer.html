<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Once again the Philistines came up, and were spread out in the valley of Rephaim.  When David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he said, “You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.  When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then be on the alert; for then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”  David did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him; and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.</p> <h3>David Brings the Ark to Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.  David and all the people with him set out and went from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts who is enthroned on the cherubim.  They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart  with the ark of God; and Ahio went in front of the ark.  David and all the house of Israel were dancing before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all their might, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.</p> <p>When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen shook it.  The anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there because he reached out his hand to the ark; and he died there beside the ark of God.  David was angry because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had burst forth with an outburst upon Uzzah; so that place is called Perez-uzzah, to this day.  David was afraid of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that day; he said, “How can the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> come into my care?”  So David was unwilling to take the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> into his care in the city of David; instead David took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.  The ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed Obed-edom and all his household.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <p>“You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know—  this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law.  But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.  For David says concerning him,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘I saw the Lord always before me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;</span><br>therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>moreover my flesh will live in hope.</span><br>For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or let your Holy One experience corruption.</span><br>You have made known to me the ways of life;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’</span></p></div> <p>“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.  Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.  Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘He was not abandoned to Hades,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor did his flesh experience corruption.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.  Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you both see and hear.  For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The Lord said to my Lord,<br>“Sit at my right hand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified.”</p>
