<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Absalom Avenges the Violation of His Sister</h3>
<p>After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.  Absalom came to the king, and said, “Your servant has sheepshearers; will the king and his servants please go with your servant?”  But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, or else we will be burdensome to you.” He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.  Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”  But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. Absalom made a feast like a king’s feast.  Then Absalom commanded his servants, “Watch when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not be afraid; have I not myself commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.”  So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons rose, and each mounted his mule and fled.</p> <p>While they were on the way, the report came to David that Absalom had killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them was left.  The king rose, tore his garments, and lay on the ground; and all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.  But Jonadab, the son of David’s brother Shimeah, said, “Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; Amnon alone is dead. This has been determined by Absalom from the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.  Now therefore, do not let my lord the king take it to heart, as if all the king’s sons were dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”</p> <p>But Absalom fled. When the young man who kept watch looked up, he saw many people coming from the Horonaim road by the side of the mountain.  Jonadab said to the king, “See, the king’s sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.”  As soon as he had finished speaking, the king’s sons arrived, and raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.</p> <p>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son day after day.  Absalom, having fled to Geshur, stayed there three years.  And the heart of the king went out, yearning for Absalom; for he was now consoled over the death of Amnon.</p>

 <h3>The Apostles Heal Many</h3>
<p>Now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico.  None of the rest dared to join them, but the people held them in high esteem.  Yet more than ever believers were added to the Lord, great numbers of both men and women,  so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mats, in order that Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he came by.  A great number of people would also gather from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all cured.</p> <h3>The Apostles Are Persecuted</h3>
<p>Then the high priest took action; he and all who were with him (that is, the sect of the Sadducees), being filled with jealousy,  arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.  But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, brought them out, and said,  “Go, stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life.”  When they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching.</p>
<p>When the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.  But when the temple police went there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported,  “We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”  Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about them, wondering what might be going on.  Then someone arrived and announced, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”  Then the captain went with the temple police and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</p>
