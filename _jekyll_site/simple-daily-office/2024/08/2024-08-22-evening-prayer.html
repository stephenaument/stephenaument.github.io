<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<h3>2 Sam 19:1-23</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-2">It was told Joab, “The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”  So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the troops; for the troops heard that day, “The king is grieving for his son.”  The troops stole into the city that day as soldiers steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle.  The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!”  Then Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have covered with shame the faces of all your officers who have saved your life today, and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and your concubines,  for love of those who hate you and for hatred of those who love you. You have made it clear today that commanders and officers are nothing to you; for I perceive that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.  So go out at once and speak kindly to your servants; for I swear by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night; and this will be worse for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your youth until now.”  Then the king got up and took his seat in the gate. The troops were all told, “See, the king is sitting in the gate”; and all the troops came before the king.</p>
<h3>David Recalled to Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, all the Israelites had fled to their homes.  All the people were disputing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and saved us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom.  But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”</p> <p>King David sent this message to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king.  You are my kin, you are my bone and my flesh; why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’  And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? So may God do to me, and more, if you are not the commander of my army from now on, in place of Joab.’”  Amasa swayed the hearts of all the people of Judah as one, and they sent word to the king, “Return, both you and all your servants.”  So the king came back to the Jordan; and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring him over the Jordan.</p> <p>Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the people of Judah to meet King David;  with him were a thousand people from Benjamin. And Ziba, the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan ahead of the king,  while the crossing was taking place, to bring over the king’s household, and to do his pleasure.</p>
<h3>David’s Mercy to Shimei</h3>
<p>Shimei son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan,  and said to the king, “May my lord not hold me guilty or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem; may the king not bear it in mind.  For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore, see, I have come this day, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”  Abishai son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed?”  But David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should today become an adversary to me? Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?”  The king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king gave him his oath.</p>

 <h3>Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch</h3>
<p>Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a wilderness road.)  So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship  and was returning home; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.  Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot and join it.”  So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”  He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.  Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and like a lamb silent before its shearer,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>so he does not open his mouth.</span><br>In his humiliation justice was denied him.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Who can describe his generation?</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>For his life is taken away from the earth.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">The eunuch asked Philip, “About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”  Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus.  As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptized?”  He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.  When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.  But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</p>
