<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Birth of Samson</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p> <p>There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren, having borne no children.  And the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to the woman and said to her, “Although you are barren, having borne no children, you shall conceive and bear a son.  Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or to eat anything unclean,  for you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor is to come on his head, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth. It is he who shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”  Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, most awe-inspiring; I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name;  but he said to me, ‘You shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’”</p> <p>Then Manoah entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I pray, let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and teach us what we are to do concerning the boy who will be born.”  God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.  So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.”  Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to this woman?” And he said, “I am.”  Then Manoah said, “Now when your words come true, what is to be the boy’s rule of life; what is he to do?”  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Manoah, “Let the woman give heed to all that I said to her.  She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine. She is not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She is to observe everything that I commanded her.”</p> <p>Manoah said to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Allow us to detain you, and prepare a kid for you.”  </p>

<h3>13. A Song of Praise <em class="latin_name">Benedictus es, Domine</em></h3>

 <h3>Jesus and John the Baptist</h3>
<p>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he spent some time there with them and baptized.  John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was abundant there; and people kept coming and were being baptized  —John, of course, had not yet been thrown into prison.</p> <p>Now a discussion about purification arose between John’s disciples and a Jew.  They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing, and all are going to him.”  John answered, “No one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven.  You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him.’  He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. For this reason my joy has been fulfilled.  He must increase, but I must decrease.”</p> <h3>The One Who Comes from Heaven</h3>
<p>The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is above all.  He testifies to what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.  Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this, that God is true.  He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.  The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hands.  Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but must endure God’s wrath.</p>
