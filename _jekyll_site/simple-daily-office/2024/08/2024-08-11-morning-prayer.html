<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jephthah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now Jephthah the Gileadite, the son of a prostitute, was a mighty warrior. Gilead was the father of Jephthah.  Gilead’s wife also bore him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away, saying to him, “You shall not inherit anything in our father’s house; for you are the son of another woman.”  Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws collected around Jephthah and went raiding with him.</p> <p>After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.  And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob.  They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander, so that we may fight with the Ammonites.”  But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Are you not the very ones who rejected me and drove me out of my father’s house? So why do you come to me now when you are in trouble?”  The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Nevertheless, we have now turned back to you, so that you may go with us and fight with the Ammonites, and become head over us, over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”  Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the Ammonites, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives them over to me, I will be your head.”  And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will be witness between us; we will surely do as you say.”  So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Mizpah.</p>

 <h3>Jephthah’s Vow</h3>
<p>Then the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh. He passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.  And Jephthah made a vow to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “If you will give the Ammonites into my hand,  then whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s, to be offered up by me as a burnt offering.”  So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them into his hand.  He inflicted a massive defeat on them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty towns, and as far as Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.</p> <h3>Jephthah’s Daughter</h3>
<p>Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah; and there was his daughter coming out to meet him with timbrels and with dancing. She was his only child; he had no son or daughter except her.  When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low; you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and I cannot take back my vow.”  She said to him, “My father, if you have opened your mouth to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you vengeance against your enemies, the Ammonites.”  And she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: Grant me two months, so that I may go and wander on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, my companions and I.”  “Go,” he said and sent her away for two months. So she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.  At the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to the vow he had made. She had never slept with a man. So there arose an Israelite custom that  for four days every year the daughters of Israel would go out to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Stills a Storm</h3>
<p>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”  And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him.  A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped.  But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”  He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm.  He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?”  And they were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</p>
