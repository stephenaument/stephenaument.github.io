<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.  The rich man had very many flocks and herds;  but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. He brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his meager fare, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him.  Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was loath to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared that for the guest who had come to him.”  Then David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man. He said to Nathan, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, the man who has done this deserves to die;  he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.”</p> <p>Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul;  I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added as much more.  Why have you despised the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.  Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, for you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I will raise up trouble against you from within your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this very sun.  For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.”  David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” Nathan said to David, “Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has put away your sin; you shall not die.  Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the child that is born to you shall die.”  </p>

 <p>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus.  When they saw the man who had been cured standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.  So they ordered them to leave the council while they discussed the matter with one another.  They said, “What will we do with them? For it is obvious to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it.  But to keep it from spreading further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.”  So they called them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.  But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;  for we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.”  After threatening them again, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all of them praised God for what had happened.  For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</p> <h3>The Believers Pray for Boldness</h3>
<p>After they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.  When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them,  it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Why did the Gentiles rage,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the peoples imagine vain things?</span><br>The kings of the earth took their stand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the rulers have gathered together</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>against the Lord and against his Messiah.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For in this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,  to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.  And now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,  while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”  When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.</p>
