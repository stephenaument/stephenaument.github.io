<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also coming with us? Go back, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from your home.  You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, while I go wherever I can? Go back, and take your kinsfolk with you; and may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.”  But Ittai answered the king, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or for life, there also your servant will be.”  David said to Ittai, “Go then, march on.” So Ittai the Gittite marched on, with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.  The whole country wept aloud as all the people passed by; the king crossed the Wadi Kidron, and all the people moved on toward the wilderness.</p> <p>Abiathar came up, and Zadok also, with all the Levites, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city.  Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he will bring me back and let me see both it and the place where it stays.  But if he says, ‘I take no pleasure in you,’ here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.”  The king also said to the priest Zadok, “Look, go back to the city in peace, you and Abiathar, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar.  See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.”  So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.</p> <p>But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot; and all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.  David was told that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”</p> <h3>Hushai Becomes David’s Spy</h3>
<p>When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head.  David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.  But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,’ then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.  The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there. So whatever you hear from the king’s house, tell it to the priests Zadok and Abiathar.  Their two sons are with them there, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan; and by them you shall report to me everything you hear.”  So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.</p>

 <p>“But as the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, our people in Egypt increased and multiplied  until another king who had not known Joseph ruled over Egypt.  He dealt craftily with our race and forced our ancestors to abandon their infants so that they would die.  At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful before God. For three months he was brought up in his father’s house;  and when he was abandoned, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.  So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds.</p> <p>“When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his relatives, the Israelites.  When he saw one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.  He supposed that his kinsfolk would understand that God through him was rescuing them, but they did not understand.  The next day he came to some of them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?’  But the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?  Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’  When he heard this, Moses fled and became a resident alien in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.</p>
