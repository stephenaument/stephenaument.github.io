<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <h3>Psalm 1</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, *</p> <p class="indent">nor lingered in the way of sinners,</p> <p class="indent">nor sat in the seats of the scornful!</p> <p class="space">Their delight is in the law of the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, *</p> <p class="indent">and they meditate on his law day and night.</p> <p class="space">They are like trees planted by streams of water,</p> <p>bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *</p> <p class="indent">everything they do shall prosper.</p> <p class="space">It is not so with the wicked; * they are like chaff which the wind blows away.</p> <p class="space">Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment comes, *</p> <p class="indent">nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.</p> <p class="space">For the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> knows the way of the righteous, *</p> <p class="indent">but the way of the wicked is doomed.</p>

 <p>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”  So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.  Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day;  for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.  Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.  Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me.  This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.”  He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.</p>
