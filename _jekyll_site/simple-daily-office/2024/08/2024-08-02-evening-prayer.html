<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Anointed King of All Israel</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Look, we are your bone and flesh.  For some time, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out Israel and brought it in. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel.”  So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and they anointed David king over Israel.  David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.  At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</p> <h3>Jerusalem Made Capital of the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>The king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, “You will not come in here, even the blind and the lame will turn you back”—thinking, “David cannot come in here.”  Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David.  David had said on that day, “Whoever would strike down the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack the lame and the blind, those whom David hates.” Therefore it is said, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”  David occupied the stronghold, and named it the city of David. David built the city all around from the Millo inward.  And David became greater and greater, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, was with him.</p> <p>King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar trees, and carpenters and masons who built David a house.  David then perceived that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</p>

 <h3>The Coming of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.  And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.  Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them.  All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.</p> <p>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem.  And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each.  Amazed and astonished, they asked, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?  And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?  Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,  Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,  Cretans and Arabs—in our own languages we hear them speaking about God’s deeds of power.”  All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”  But others sneered and said, “They are filled with new wine.”</p> <h3>Peter Addresses the Crowd</h3>
<p>But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say.  Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning.  No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘In the last days it will be, God declares,<br>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</span><br>and your young men shall see visions,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your old men shall dream dreams.</span><br>Even upon my slaves, both men and women,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in those days I will pour out my Spirit;</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and they shall prophesy.</span><br>And I will show portents in the heaven above<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and signs on the earth below,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>blood, and fire, and smoky mist.</span><br>The sun shall be turned to darkness<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the moon to blood,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.</span><br>Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</p></div>
