<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Job and His Family</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.  There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.  He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.  His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another’s houses in turn; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.  And when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.” This is what Job always did.</p> <h3>Attack on Job’s Character</h3>
<p>One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil.”  Then Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Does Job fear God for nothing?  Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.  But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him!” So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Job Loses Property and Children</h3>
<p>One day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the eldest brother’s house,  a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them,  and the Sabeans fell on them and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.”  While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; I alone have escaped to tell you.”  While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three columns, made a raid on the camels and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.”  While he was still speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,  and suddenly a great wind came across the desert, struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p> <p>Then Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell on the ground and worshiped.  He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has taken away; blessed be the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Walks on the Water</h3>
<p>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,  got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.  The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.  When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were terrified.  But he said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.”  Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.</p> <h3>The Bread from Heaven</h3>
<p>The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there. They also saw that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.  Then some boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.  So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus.</p> <p>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”  Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.  Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”  </p>
