<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>It was told King David, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing;  and when those who bore the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.  David danced before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all his might; David was girded with a linen ephod.  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p> <p>As the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came into the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and she despised him in her heart.</p> <p>They brought in the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the offerings of well-being, he blessed the people in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  and distributed food among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people went back to their homes.</p> <p>David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants’ maids, as any vulgar fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!”  David said to Michal, “It was before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who chose me in place of your father and all his household, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that I have danced before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in my own eyes; but by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor.”  And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</p>

 <p>The point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.  Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.  And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that by always having enough of everything, you may share abundantly in every good work.  As it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>his righteousness endures forever.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.  You will be enriched in every way for your great generosity, which will produce thanksgiving to God through us;  for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God.  Through the testing of this ministry you glorify God by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others,  while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God that he has given you.  Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</p>
