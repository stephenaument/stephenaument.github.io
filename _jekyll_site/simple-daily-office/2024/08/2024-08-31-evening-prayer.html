<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was finished. Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Dedication of the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> out of the city of David, which is Zion.  All the people of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the festival in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.  And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark.  So they brought up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.  King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.  Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.  For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.  The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; they are there to this day.  There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites, when they came out of the land of Egypt.  And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Then Solomon said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.<br>I have built you an exalted house,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a place for you to dwell in forever.”</span></p></div> <h3>Solomon’s Speech</h3>
<p>Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.  He said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying,  ‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’  My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to my father David, ‘You did well to consider building a house for my name;  nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’  Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has upheld the promise that he made; for I have risen in the place of my father David; I sit on the throne of Israel, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> promised, and have built the house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.  There I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”</p> </div>

 <h3>Peter’s Report to the Church at Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God.  So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him,  saying, “Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?”  Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying,  “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me.  As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air.  I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’  But I replied, ‘By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’  But a second time the voice answered from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call profane.’  This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven.  At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were.  The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.  He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter;  he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.’  And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning.  And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’  If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?”  When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”</p>
