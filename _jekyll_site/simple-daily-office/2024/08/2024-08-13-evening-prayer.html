<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Absalom Returns to Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now Joab son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s mind was on Absalom.  Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman. He said to her, “Pretend to be a mourner; put on mourning garments, do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.  Go to the king and speak to him as follows.” And Joab put the words into her mouth.</p> <p>When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance, and said, “Help, O king!”  The king asked her, “What is your trouble?” She answered, “Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.  Your servant had two sons, and they fought with one another in the field; there was no one to part them, and one struck the other and killed him.  Now the whole family has risen against your servant. They say, ‘Give up the man who struck his brother, so that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he murdered, even if we destroy the heir as well.’ Thus they would quench my one remaining ember, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.”</p> <p>Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.”  The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father’s house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.”  The king said, “If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.”  Then she said, “Please, may the king keep the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God in mind, so that the avenger of blood may kill no more, and my son not be destroyed.” He said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”</p> <p>Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” He said, “Speak.”  The woman said, “Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.  We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up. But God will not take away a life; he will devise plans so as not to keep an outcast banished forever from his presence.  Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid; your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.  For the king will hear, and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would cut both me and my son off from the heritage of God.’  Your servant thought, ‘The word of my lord the king will set me at rest’; for my lord the king is like the angel of God, discerning good and evil. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God be with you!”</p> <p>Then the king answered the woman, “Do not withhold from me anything I ask you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.”  The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered and said, “As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn right or left from anything that my lord the king has said. For it was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.  In order to change the course of affairs your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.”</p>

<h3>10. The Second Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Quaerite Dominum</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <p>When they had brought them, they had them stand before the council. The high priest questioned them,  saying, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you are determined to bring this man’s blood on us.”  But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than any human authority.  The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.  God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior that he might give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.  And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”</p> <p>When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.  But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, respected by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time.  Then he said to them, “Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men.  For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him; but he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and disappeared.  After him Judas the Galilean rose up at the time of the census and got people to follow him; he also perished, and all who followed him were scattered.  So in the present case, I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; because if this plan or this undertaking is of human origin, it will fail;  but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them—in that case you may even be found fighting against God!”</p>
<p>They were convinced by him,  and when they had called in the apostles, they had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.  As they left the council, they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.  And every day in the temple and at home they did not cease to teach and proclaim Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
