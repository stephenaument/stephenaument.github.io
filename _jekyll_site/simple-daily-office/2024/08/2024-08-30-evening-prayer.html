<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Preparations and Materials for the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> Now King Hiram of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father; for Hiram had always been a friend to David.  Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying,  “You know that my father David could not build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put them under the soles of his feet.  But now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.  So I intend to build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to my father David, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.’  Therefore command that cedars from the Lebanon be cut for me. My servants will join your servants, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants; for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”</p> <p>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> today, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.”  Hiram sent word to Solomon, “I have heard the message that you have sent to me; I will fulfill all your needs in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.  My servants shall bring it down to the sea from the Lebanon; I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will have them broken up there for you to take away. And you shall meet my needs by providing food for my household.”  So Hiram supplied Solomon’s every need for timber of cedar and cypress.  Solomon in turn gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty cors of fine oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.  So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and the two of them made a treaty.</p> <p>King Solomon conscripted forced labor out of all Israel; the levy numbered thirty thousand men.  He sent them to the Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts; they would be a month in the Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.  Solomon also had seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country,  besides Solomon’s three thousand three hundred supervisors who were over the work, having charge of the people who did the work.  At the king’s command, they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.  So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did the stonecutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.</p> <h3>Solomon Builds the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  </p> <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Gentiles Hear the Good News</h3>
<p>Then Peter began to speak to them: “I truly understand that God shows no partiality,  but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.  You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all.  That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced:  how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.  We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;  but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear,  not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.  He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead.  All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p> <h3>Gentiles Receive the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.  The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,  for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said,  “Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”  So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.</p>
