<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>First Vision: The Horsemen</h3>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo; and Zechariah said,  In the night I saw a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.  Then I said, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what they are.”  So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, “They are those whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent to patrol the earth.”  Then they spoke to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and lo, the whole earth remains at peace.”  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which you have been angry these seventy years?”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> replied with gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.  So the angel who talked with me said to me, Proclaim this message: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts; I am very jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.  And I am extremely angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they made the disaster worse.  Therefore, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; my house shall be built in it, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.  Proclaim further: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.</p>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>To those who have received a faith as precious as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:</p> <p>May grace and peace be yours in abundance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p> <h3>The Christian’s Call and Election</h3>
<p>His divine power has given us everything needed for life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.  Thus he has given us, through these things, his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and may become participants of the divine nature.  For this very reason, you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness, and goodness with knowledge,  and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with endurance, and endurance with godliness,  and godliness with mutual affection, and mutual affection with love.  For if these things are yours and are increasing among you, they keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  For anyone who lacks these things is short-sighted and blind, and is forgetful of the cleansing of past sins.  Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more eager to confirm your call and election, for if you do this, you will never stumble.  For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.</p>
