<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest,  and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.  (For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned to death.”  Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”)  But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering,  and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,  and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.</p> <p>See that you do not refuse the one who is speaking; for if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject the one who warns from heaven!  At that time his voice shook the earth; but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.”  This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what is shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.  Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer to God an acceptable worship with reverence and awe;  for indeed our God is a consuming fire.</p>

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>

We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
