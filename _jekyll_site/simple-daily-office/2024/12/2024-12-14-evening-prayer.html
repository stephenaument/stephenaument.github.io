<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Future Glory of the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai, saying:  Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say,  Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?  Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; work, for I am with you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear.  For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;  and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.

 <h3>Warning against Idleness</h3>
<p>Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us.  For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you,  and we did not eat anyone’s bread without paying for it; but with toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of you.  This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to give you an example to imitate.  For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat.  For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work.  Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.  Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.</p> <p>Take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter; have nothing to do with them, so that they may be ashamed.  Do not regard them as enemies, but warn them as believers.</p> <h3>Final Greetings and Benediction</h3>
<p>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with all of you.</p> <p>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the mark in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>

We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
