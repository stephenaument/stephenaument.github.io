<div class="citation">Isaiah 40:5</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Question about David’s Son</h3>
<p>Then he said to them, “How can they say that the Messiah is David’s son?  For David himself says in the book of Psalms,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The Lord said to my Lord,<br>“Sit at my right hand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">David thus calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?”</p> <h3>Jesus Denounces the Scribes</h3>
<p>In the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples,  “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets.  They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”</p> <h3>The Widow’s Offering</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">He looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the treasury;  he also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.  He said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them;  for all of them have contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<p><p>Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of<br>darkness, and put on the armor of light, now in the time of<br>this mortal life in which your Son Jesus Christ came to visit<br>us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come<br>again in his glorious majesty to judge both the living and the<br>dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who lives<br>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and<br>for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

Amen.</p>
