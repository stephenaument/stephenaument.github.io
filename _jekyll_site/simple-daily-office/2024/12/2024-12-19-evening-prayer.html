<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Fifth Vision: The Lampstand and Olive Trees</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as one is wakened from sleep.  He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it; there are seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.  And by it there are two olive trees, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”  I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”  Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”  He said to me, “This is the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring out the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”</p> <p>Moreover the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me, saying,  “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts has sent me to you.  For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.</p>
<p>“These seven are the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which range through the whole earth.”  Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”  And a second time I said to him, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which pour out the oil through the two golden pipes?”  He said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”  Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”</p>

<p> —especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust, and who despise authority.</p>
<p>Bold and willful, they are not afraid to slander the glorious ones,  whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not bring against them a slanderous judgment from the Lord.  These people, however, are like irrational animals, mere creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed. They slander what they do not understand, and when those creatures are destroyed, they also will be destroyed,  suffering the penalty for doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their dissipation while they feast with you.  They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!  They have left the straight road and have gone astray, following the road of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the wages of doing wrong,  but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.</p>
