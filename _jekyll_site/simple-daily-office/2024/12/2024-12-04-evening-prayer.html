<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h3>


  <h3>Psalm 12</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Help me, L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for there is no godly one left; *</p> <p class="indent">the faithful have vanished from among us.</p> <p class="space">Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *</p> <p class="indent">with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.</p> <p class="space">Oh, that the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> would cut off all smooth tongues, *</p> <p class="indent">and close the lips that utter proud boasts!</p> <p class="space">Those who say, "With our tongue will we prevail; *</p> <p class="indent">our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"</p> <p>"Because the needy are oppressed,</p> <p>and the poor cry out in misery, *</p> <p class="indent">I will rise up," says the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>,</p> <p class="indent">"and give them the help they long for."</p> <p>&nbsp;The words of the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> are pure words, *</p> <p class="indent">like silver refined from ore</p> <p class="indent">and purified seven times in the fire.</p> <p class="space">O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, watch over us *</p> <p class="indent">and save us from this generation for ever.</p> <p class="space">The wicked prowl on every side, *</p> <p class="indent">and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</p>
  </div>

  <p> Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.
  </p>

  <h3>Psalm 13</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>How long, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>?</p> <p>will you forget me for ever? *</p> <p class="indent">how long will you hide your face from me?</p> <p>How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,</p> <p>and grief in my heart, day after day? *</p> <p class="indent">how long shall my enemy triumph over me?</p> <p class="space">Look upon me and answer me, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> my God; *</p> <p class="indent">give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</p> <p class="space">Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," *</p> <p class="indent">and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.</p> <p class="space">But I put my trust in your mercy; *</p> <p class="indent">my heart is joyful because of your saving help.</p> <p class="space">I will sing to the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for he has dealt with me richly; *</p> <p class="indent">I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.</p>

    <p>The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." *</p> <p class="indent">All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;</p> <p class="indent">there is none who does any good.</p> <p class="space">The L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> looks down from heaven upon us all, *</p> <p class="indent">to see if there is any who is wise,</p> <p class="indent">if there is one who seeks after God.</p> <p class="space">Every one has proved faithless;</p> <p>all alike have turned bad; *</p> <p class="indent">there is none who does good; no, not one.</p> <p class="space">Have they no knowledge, all those evildoers *</p> <p class="indent">who eat up my people like bread</p> <p class="indent">and do not call upon the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>?</p> <p class="space">See how they tremble with fear, *</p> <p class="indent">because God is in the company of the righteous.</p> <p class="space">Their aim is to confound the plans of the afflicted, *</p> <p class="indent">but the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> is their refuge.</p> <p>Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *</p> <p class="indent">when the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> restores the fortunes of his people,</p> <p class="indent">Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.</p>

 <p>We also constantly give thanks to God for this, that when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is, God’s word, which is also at work in you believers.  For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews,  who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out; they displease God and oppose everyone  by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. Thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins; but God’s wrath has overtaken them at last.</p> <h3>Paul’s Desire to Visit the Thessalonians Again</h3>
<p>As for us, brothers and sisters, when, for a short time, we were made orphans by being separated from you—in person, not in heart—we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face.  For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, wanted to again and again—but Satan blocked our way.  For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?  Yes, you are our glory and joy!</p>

Amen.
