<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Third Vision: The Man with a Measuring Line</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.  Then I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”  Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him,  and said to him, “Run, say to that young man: Jerusalem shall be inhabited like villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and animals in it.  For I will be a wall of fire all around it, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and I will be the glory within it.”</p> <h3>Interlude: An Appeal to the Exiles</h3>
<p>Up, up! Flee from the land of the north, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for I have spread you abroad like the four winds of heaven, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Up! Escape to Zion, you that live with daughter Babylon.  For thus said the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts (after his glory sent me) regarding the nations that plundered you: Truly, one who touches you touches the apple of my eye.  See now, I am going to raise my hand against them, and they shall become plunder for their own slaves. Then you will know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts has sent me.  Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion! For lo, I will come and dwell in your midst, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Many nations shall join themselves to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> on that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in your midst. And you shall know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts has sent me to you.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.</p> <p>Be silent, all people, before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.</p>

<h3>10. The Second Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Quaerite Dominum</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>2 Pet 1:12-21</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Therefore I intend to keep on reminding you of these things, though you know them already and are established in the truth that has come to you.  I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to refresh your memory,  since I know that my death will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.  And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.</p> <h3>Eyewitnesses of Christ’s Glory</h3>
<p>For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty.  For he received honor and glory from God the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”  We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on the holy mountain.</p> <p>So we have the prophetic message more fully confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.  First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation,  because no prophecy ever came by human will, but men and women moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
