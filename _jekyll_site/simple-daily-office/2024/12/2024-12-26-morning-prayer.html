<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Now after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and did obeisance to the king; then the king listened to them.  They abandoned the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, and served the sacred poles and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.  Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; they testified against them, but they would not listen.</p> <p>Then the spirit of God took possession of Zechariah son of the priest Jehoiada; he stood above the people and said to them, “Thus says God: Why do you transgress the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he has also forsaken you.”  But they conspired against him, and by command of the king they stoned him to death in the court of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  King Joash did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah’s father, had shown him, but killed his son.

 <h3>Seven Chosen to Serve</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now during those days, when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.  And the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said, “It is not right that we should neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.  Therefore, friends, select from among yourselves seven men of good standing, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this task,  while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word.”  What they said pleased the whole community, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, together with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch.  They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</p> <p>The word of God continued to spread; the number of the disciples increased greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.</p>
