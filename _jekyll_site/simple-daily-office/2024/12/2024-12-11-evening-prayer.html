<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,</p>
<p class="first-line-none">To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</p> <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <h3>Thanksgiving</h3>
<p>We must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.  Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring.</p> <h3>The Judgment at Christ’s Coming</h3>
<p>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering.  For it is indeed just of God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,  and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels  in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.  These will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,  when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at on that day among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.  To this end we always pray for you, asking that our God will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith,  so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
