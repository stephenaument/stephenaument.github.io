<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samuel’s Birth and Dedication</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>

<p> So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.  Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”</p> <p>After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  She was deeply distressed and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and wept bitterly.  She made this vow: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head.”</p> <p>As she continued praying before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth.  Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  So Eli said to her, “How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine.”  But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.”  Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.”  And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.</p> <p>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> remembered her.  In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.  But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and remain there forever; I will offer him as a nazirite for all time.”  Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only—may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> establish his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.  When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Shiloh; and the child was young.  Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.  And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  For this child I prayed; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has granted me the petition that I made to him.  Therefore I have lent him to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; as long as he lives, he is given to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p>She left him there for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <p>It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,  saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And again,</p>

<p class="first-line-none">And again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Here am I and the children whom God has given me.”</p></div> <p>Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.  For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham.  Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.  Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.</p>
