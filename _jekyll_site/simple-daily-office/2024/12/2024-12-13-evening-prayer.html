<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Command to Rebuild the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house.  Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai, saying:  Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?  Now therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Consider how you have fared.  You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and you that earn wages earn wages to put them into a bag with holes.</p> <p>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Consider how you have fared.  Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts. Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you hurry off to your own houses.  Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.  And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and animals, and on all their labors.</p> <p>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, and the words of the prophet Haggai, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God had sent him; and the people feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Then Haggai, the messenger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, spoke to the people with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s message, saying, I am with you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, their God,  on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month.</p>

 <h3>Chosen for Salvation</h3>
<p>But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.  For this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</p> <p>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,  comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.</p> <h3>Request for Prayer</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified everywhere, just as it is among you,  and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people; for not all have faith.  But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.  And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command.  May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
