<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Punishment for Rejecting God’s Demands</h3>
<p>The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Zechariah, saying:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another;  do not oppress the widow, the orphan, the alien, or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.  But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears in order not to hear.  They made their hearts adamant in order not to hear the law and the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  Just as, when I called, they would not hear, so, when they called, I would not hear, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and a pleasant land was made desolate.</p> <h3>God’s Promises to Zion</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts came to me, saying:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts shall be called the holy mountain.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of their great age.  And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Even though it seems impossible to the remnant of this people in these days, should it also seem impossible to me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts?  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: I will save my people from the east country and from the west country;  and I will bring them to live in Jerusalem. They shall be my people and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <p>These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm; for them the deepest darkness has been reserved.  For they speak bombastic nonsense, and with licentious desires of the flesh they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error.  They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption; for people are slaves to whatever masters them.  For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overpowered, the last state has become worse for them than the first.  For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment that was passed on to them.  It has happened to them according to the true proverb,</p>
