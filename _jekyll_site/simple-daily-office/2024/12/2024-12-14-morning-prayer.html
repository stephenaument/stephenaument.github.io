<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Isaiah’s Son a Sign of the Assyrian Invasion</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, “Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz,”  and have it attested for me by reliable witnesses, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah.  And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz;  for before the child knows how to call “My father” or “My mother,” the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to me again:  Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and melt in fear before Rezin and the son of Remaliah;  therefore, the Lord is bringing up against it the mighty flood waters of the River, the king of Assyria and all his glory; it will rise above all its channels and overflow all its banks;  it will sweep on into Judah as a flood, and, pouring over, it will reach up to the neck; and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.</p> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">Band together, you peoples, and be dismayed;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>listen, all you far countries;</span><br>gird yourselves and be dismayed;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>gird yourselves and be dismayed!</span><br>Take counsel together, but it shall be brought to naught;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>speak a word, but it will not stand,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for God is with us.</span></p></div> <p>For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke thus to me while his hand was strong upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:  Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what it fears, or be in dread.  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.  He will become a sanctuary, a stone one strikes against; for both houses of Israel he will become a rock one stumbles over—a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  And many among them shall stumble; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial</h3>
<p>“Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,  but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”  And he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!”  Jesus said, “I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me.”</p> <h3>Purse, Bag, and Sword</h3>
<p>He said to them, “When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “No, not a thing.”  He said to them, “But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.  For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was counted among the lawless’; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.”  They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” He replied, “It is enough.”</p>
