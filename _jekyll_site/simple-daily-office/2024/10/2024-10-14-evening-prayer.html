<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Scroll Read in the Palace</h3>
<p>When Micaiah son of Gemariah son of Shaphan heard all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> from the scroll,  he went down to the king’s house, into the secretary’s chamber; and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the officials.  And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.  Then all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son of Cushi to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.  And they said to him, “Sit down and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them.  When they heard all the words, they turned to one another in alarm, and said to Baruch, “We certainly must report all these words to the king.”  Then they questioned Baruch, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”  Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”  Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”</p> <h3>Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll</h3>
<p>Leaving the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, they went to the court of the king; and they reported all the words to the king.  Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary; and Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.  Now the king was sitting in his winter apartment (it was the ninth month), and there was a fire burning in the brazier before him.  As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.  Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words, was alarmed, nor did they tear their garments.  Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.  And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the secretary Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hid them.</p>

 <h3>Paul Defends Himself before Agrippa</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and began to defend himself:</p> <p>“I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,  because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg of you to listen to me patiently.</p> <p>“All the Jews know my way of life from my youth, a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem.  They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I have belonged to the strictest sect of our religion and lived as a Pharisee.  And now I stand here on trial on account of my hope in the promise made by God to our ancestors,  a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship day and night. It is for this hope, your Excellency, that I am accused by Jews!  Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</p> <p>“Indeed, I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.  And that is what I did in Jerusalem; with authority received from the chief priests, I not only locked up many of the saints in prison, but I also cast my vote against them when they were being condemned to death.  By punishing them often in all the synagogues I tried to force them to blaspheme; and since I was so furiously enraged at them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.</p> <h3>Paul Tells of His Conversion</h3>
<p>“With this in mind, I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,  when at midday along the road, your Excellency, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions.  When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.’  I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord answered, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.  But get up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and testify to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you.  I will rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles—to whom I am sending you  to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</p> <h3>Paul Tells of His Preaching</h3>
<p>“After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,  but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout the countryside of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds consistent with repentance.  For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.  To this day I have had help from God, and so I stand here, testifying to both small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would take place:  that the Messiah must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”</p>
