<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Command to Rebuild the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house.  Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai, saying:  Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?  Now therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Consider how you have fared.  You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and you that earn wages earn wages to put them into a bag with holes.</p> <p>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Consider how you have fared.  Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts. Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you hurry off to your own houses.  Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.  And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and animals, and on all their labors.</p> <p>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, and the words of the prophet Haggai, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God had sent him; and the people feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Then Haggai, the messenger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, spoke to the people with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s message, saying, I am with you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, their God,  on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month.</p> <h3>The Future Glory of the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai, saying:  Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say,  Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?  Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; work, for I am with you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear.  For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;  and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.</p> </div>

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.  The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?  Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.  Consider the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?  What do I imply then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?  No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.  You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.  Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p> <h3>Do All to the Glory of God</h3>
<p>“All things are lawful,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.  Do not seek your own advantage, but that of the other.  </p>
