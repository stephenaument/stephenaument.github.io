<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Josiah Reigns over Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.  He did what was right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and walked in all the way of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.</p> <h3>Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law</h3>
<p>In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying,  “Go up to the high priest Hilkiah, and have him count the entire sum of the money that has been brought into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people;  let it be given into the hand of the workers who have the oversight of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; let them give it to the workers who are at the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, repairing the house,  that is, to the carpenters, to the builders, to the masons; and let them use it to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the house.  But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered into their hand, for they deal honestly.”</p> <p>The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” When Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, he read it.  Then Shaphan the secretary came to the king, and reported to the king, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workers who have oversight of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “The priest Hilkiah has given me a book.” Shaphan then read it aloud to the king.</p> <p>When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.  Then the king commanded the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary, and the king’s servant Asaiah, saying,  “Go, inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that is kindled against us, because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”</p>

 <h3>The Plot to Kill Paul</h3>
<p>In the morning the Jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.  There were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy.  They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed Paul.  Now then, you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you, on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case. And we are ready to do away with him before he arrives.”</p> <p>Now the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush; so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told Paul.  Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to report to him.”  So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you; he has something to tell you.”  The tribune took him by the hand, drew him aside privately, and asked, “What is it that you have to report to me?”  He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into his case.  But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him. They have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him. They are ready now and are waiting for your consent.”  So the tribune dismissed the young man, ordering him, “Tell no one that you have informed me of this.”</p> <h3>Paul Sent to Felix the Governor</h3>
<p>Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get ready to leave by nine o’clock tonight for Caesarea with two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen.  Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Felix the governor.”  </p>
