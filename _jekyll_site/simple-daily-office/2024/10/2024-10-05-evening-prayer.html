<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Paul Sent to the Gentiles</h3>
<p>“After I had returned to Jerusalem and while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance  and saw Jesus saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’  And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.  And while the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing by, approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him.’  Then he said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”</p> <h3>Paul and the Roman Tribune</h3>
<p>Up to this point they listened to him, but then they shouted, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.”  And while they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and tossing dust into the air,  the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by flogging, to find out the reason for this outcry against him.  But when they had tied him up with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who is uncondemned?”  When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen.”  The tribune came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”  The tribune answered, “It cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship.” Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”  Immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</p>
