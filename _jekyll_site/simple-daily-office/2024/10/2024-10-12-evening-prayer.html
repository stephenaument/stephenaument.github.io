<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Rechabites Commended</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The word that came to Jeremiah from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:  Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.  So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.  I brought them to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.  Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Have some wine.”  But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‘You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children;  nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.’  We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,  and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed;  but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.  But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.”</p> <p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Jeremiah:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The command has been carried out that Jonadab son of Rechab gave to his descendants to drink no wine; and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their ancestor’s command. But I myself have spoken to you persistently, and you have not obeyed me.  I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, “Turn now every one of you from your evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall live in the land that I gave to you and your ancestors.” But you did not incline your ear or obey me.  The descendants of Jonadab son of Rechab have carried out the command that their ancestor gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.  Therefore, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: I am going to bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem every disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered.</p> <p>But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of your ancestor Jonadab, and kept all his precepts, and done all that he commanded you,  therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab son of Rechab shall not lack a descendant to stand before me for all time.</p>

 <h3>Festus Consults King Agrippa</h3>
<p>After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus.  Since they were staying there several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix.  When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him and asked for a sentence against him.  I told them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met the accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the charge.  So when they met here, I lost no time, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.  When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the crimes that I was expecting.  Instead they had certain points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.  Since I was at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges.  But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of his Imperial Majesty, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to the emperor.”  Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”</p> <h3>Paul Brought before Agrippa</h3>
<p>So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then Festus gave the order and Paul was brought in.  And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish community petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.  But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and when he appealed to his Imperial Majesty, I decided to send him.  But I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write—  for it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him.”</p>
