<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Hezekiah Consults Isaiah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.  They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.  It may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God heard all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.”  When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,  Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me.  I myself will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’”</p> <h3>Sennacherib’s Threat</h3>
<p>The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.  When the king heard concerning King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, “See, he has set out to fight against you,” he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,  “Thus shall you speak to King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.  See, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?  Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my predecessors destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?  Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?”</p> <h3>Hezekiah’s Prayer</h3>
<p>Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then Hezekiah went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and spread it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And Hezekiah prayed before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, you are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.  Incline your ear, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and hear; open your eyes, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and see; hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.  Truly, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,  and have hurled their gods into the fire, though they were no gods but the work of human hands—wood and stone—and so they were destroyed.  So now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, save us, I pray you, from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are God alone.”</p> <p>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria.  </p>

 <h3>Paul Defends Himself</h3>
<p>Just as Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?” The tribune replied, “Do you know Greek?  Then you are not the Egyptian who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?”  Paul replied, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of an important city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.”  When he had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people for silence; and when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:</p> <p class="chapter-2">“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense that I now make before you.”</p> <p>When they heard him addressing them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet. Then he said:</p> <p>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated strictly according to our ancestral law, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today.  I persecuted this Way up to the point of death by binding both men and women and putting them in prison,  as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I went there in order to bind those who were there and to bring them back to Jerusalem for punishment.</p> <h3>Paul Tells of His Conversion</h3>
<p>“While I was on my way and approaching Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me.  I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’  I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ Then he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’  Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me.  I asked, ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go to Damascus; there you will be told everything that has been assigned to you to do.’  Since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, those who were with me took my hand and led me to Damascus.</p> <p>“A certain Ananias, who was a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews living there,  came to me; and standing beside me, he said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight!’ In that very hour I regained my sight and saw him.  Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear his own voice;  for you will be his witness to all the world of what you have seen and heard.  And now why do you delay? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away, calling on his name.’</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
