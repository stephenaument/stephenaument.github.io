<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Worship Restored at Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When the seventh month came, and the Israelites were in the towns, the people gathered together in Jerusalem.  Then Jeshua son of Jozadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his kin set out to build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as prescribed in the law of Moses the man of God.  They set up the altar on its foundation, because they were in dread of the neighboring peoples, and they offered burnt offerings upon it to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, morning and evening.  And they kept the festival of booths, as prescribed, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as required for each day,  and after that the regular burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the sacred festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. But the foundation of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not yet laid.  So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from King Cyrus of Persia.</p> <h3>Foundation Laid for the Temple</h3>
<p>In the second year after their arrival at the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their people, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And Jeshua with his sons and his kin, and Kadmiel and his sons, Binnui and Hodaviah along with the sons of Henadad, the Levites, their sons and kin, together took charge of the workers in the house of God.</p> <p>When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the priests in their vestments were stationed to praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, according to the directions of King David of Israel;  and they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For he is good,<br>for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel.”</p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">And all the people responded with a great shout when they praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because the foundation of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was laid.  But many of the priests and Levites and heads of families, old people who had seen the first house on its foundations, wept with a loud voice when they saw this house, though many shouted aloud for joy,  so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people shouted so loudly that the sound was heard far away.</p>

 <p>Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,  saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”  So the four angels were released, who had been held ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, to kill a third of humankind.  The number of the troops of cavalry was two hundred million; I heard their number.  And this was how I saw the horses in my vision: the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur; the heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths.  By these three plagues a third of humankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.  For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they inflict harm.</p> <p>The rest of humankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands or give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.  And they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their fornication or their thefts.</p>
