<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h3>


  <h3>Psalm 12</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Help me, L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for there is no godly one left; *</p> <p class="indent">the faithful have vanished from among us.</p> <p class="space">Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *</p> <p class="indent">with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.</p> <p class="space">Oh, that the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> would cut off all smooth tongues, *</p> <p class="indent">and close the lips that utter proud boasts!</p> <p class="space">Those who say, "With our tongue will we prevail; *</p> <p class="indent">our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"</p> <p>"Because the needy are oppressed,</p> <p>and the poor cry out in misery, *</p> <p class="indent">I will rise up," says the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>,</p> <p class="indent">"and give them the help they long for."</p> <p>&nbsp;The words of the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> are pure words, *</p> <p class="indent">like silver refined from ore</p> <p class="indent">and purified seven times in the fire.</p> <p class="space">O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, watch over us *</p> <p class="indent">and save us from this generation for ever.</p> <p class="space">The wicked prowl on every side, *</p> <p class="indent">and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah saying, “Please pray for us to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God.”  Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.  Meanwhile, the army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.</p> <p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to the prophet Jeremiah:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of Israel: This is what the two of you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Pharaoh’s army, which set out to help you, is going to return to its own land, to Egypt.  And the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go away.  Even if you defeated the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men in their tents, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.</p> <h3>Jeremiah Is Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh’s army,  Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his share of property among the people there.  When he reached the Benjamin Gate, a sentinel there named Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah arrested the prophet Jeremiah saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”  And Jeremiah said, “That is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.  The officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of the secretary Jonathan, for it had been made a prison.  Thus Jeremiah was put in the cistern house, in the cells, and remained there many days.</p> <p>Then King Zedekiah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?” Jeremiah said, “There is!” Then he said, “You shall be handed over to the king of Babylon.”  Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?  Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?  Now please hear me, my lord king: be good enough to listen to my plea, and do not send me back to the house of the secretary Jonathan to die there.”  So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p>

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous, because even the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,  saying, “Sirs, I can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”  But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.  Since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter, the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, where they could spend the winter. It was a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest.</p> <h3>The Storm at Sea</h3>
<p>When a moderate south wind began to blow, they thought they could achieve their purpose; so they weighed anchor and began to sail past Crete, close to the shore.  But soon a violent wind, called the northeaster, rushed down from Crete.  Since the ship was caught and could not be turned head-on into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven.  By running under the lee of a small island called Cauda we were scarcely able to get the ship’s boat under control.  After hoisting it up they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they would run on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven.  We were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard,  and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ship’s tackle overboard.  When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest raged, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.</p> <p>Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul then stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss.  I urge you now to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.  For last night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,  and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before the emperor; and indeed, God has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you.’  So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.  But we will have to run aground on some island.”</p>
