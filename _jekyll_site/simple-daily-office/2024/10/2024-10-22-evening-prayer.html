<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Multitude from Every Nation</h3>

Amen.”</p></div> <p>Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, robed in white, and where have they come from?”  I said to him, “Sir, you are the one that knows.” Then he said to me, “These are they who have come out of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">For this reason they are before the throne of God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and worship him day and night within his temple,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.</span><br>They will hunger no more, and thirst no more;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the sun will not strike them,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor any scorching heat;</span><br>for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,</span><br>and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”</p></div>
