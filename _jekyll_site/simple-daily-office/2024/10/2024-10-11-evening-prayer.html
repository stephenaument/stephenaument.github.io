<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jehoiakim Reigns over Judah</h3>
<p>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.  He did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, just as all his ancestors had done.</p> <h3>Judah Overrun by Enemies</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In his days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up; Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, bands of the Arameans, bands of the Moabites, and bands of the Ammonites; he sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he spoke by his servants the prophets.  Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, for all that he had committed,  and also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not willing to pardon.  Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?  So Jehoiakim slept with his ancestors; then his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.  The king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken over all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Wadi of Egypt to the River Euphrates.</p> <h3>Reign and Captivity of Jehoiachin</h3>
<p>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.  He did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, just as his father had done.</p> <p>At that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.  King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it;  King Jehoiachin of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself, his mother, his servants, his officers, and his palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his reign.</p> <h3>Capture of Jerusalem</h3>
<p>He carried off all the treasures of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the treasures of the king’s house; he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which King Solomon of Israel had made, all this as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had foretold.  He carried away all Jerusalem, all the officials, all the warriors, ten thousand captives, all the artisans and the smiths; no one remained, except the poorest people of the land.  He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officials, and the elite of the land, he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.  The king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, seven thousand, the artisans and the smiths, one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war.  The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</p> </div>

 <h3>Paul Held in Custody</h3>
<p>Some days later when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him speak concerning faith in Christ Jesus.  And as he discussed justice, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for the present; when I have an opportunity, I will send for you.”  At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul, and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him.</p> <p>After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and since he wanted to grant the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</p> <h3>Paul Appeals to the Emperor</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem  where the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews gave him a report against Paul. They appealed to him  and requested, as a favor to them against Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem. They were, in fact, planning an ambush to kill him along the way.  Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.  “So,” he said, “let those of you who have the authority come down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him.”</p> <p>After he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.  When he arrived, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem surrounded him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.  Paul said in his defense, “I have in no way committed an offense against the law of the Jews, or against the temple, or against the emperor.”  But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges?”  Paul said, “I am appealing to the emperor’s tribunal; this is where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.  Now if I am in the wrong and have committed something for which I deserve to die, I am not trying to escape death; but if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can turn me over to them. I appeal to the emperor.”  Then Festus, after he had conferred with his council, replied, “You have appealed to the emperor; to the emperor you will go.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to<br>hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire<br>or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy,<br>forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid,<br>and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy<br>to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus<br>Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Fridays</h3>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.
</p>


<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
