<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>The king commanded the high priest Hilkiah, the priests of the second order, and the guardians of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.  He deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who made offerings to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and all the host of the heavens.  He brought out the image of Asherah from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, outside Jerusalem, to the Wadi Kidron, burned it at the Wadi Kidron, beat it to dust and threw the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.  He broke down the houses of the male temple prostitutes that were in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, where the women did weaving for Asherah.  He brought all the priests out of the towns of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beer-sheba; he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on the left at the gate of the city.  The priests of the high places, however, did not come up to the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Jerusalem, but ate unleavened bread among their kindred.  He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, so that no one would make a son or a daughter pass through fire as an offering to Molech.  He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, by the chamber of the eunuch Nathan-melech, which was in the precincts; then he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.  The altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he pulled down from there and broke in pieces, and threw the rubble into the Wadi Kidron.  The king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Destruction, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.  He broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the sacred poles, and covered the sites with human bones.</p> <p>Moreover, the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin—he pulled down that altar along with the high place. He burned the high place, crushing it to dust; he also burned the sacred pole.  As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that the man of God proclaimed, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the festival; he turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God who had predicted these things.  Then he said, “What is that monument that I see?” The people of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel.”  He said, “Let him rest; let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.  Moreover, Josiah removed all the shrines of the high places that were in the towns of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to anger; he did to them just as he had done at Bethel.  He slaughtered on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.</p> <h3>The Passover Celebrated</h3>
<p>The king commanded all the people, “Keep the passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God as prescribed in this book of the covenant.”  No such passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, even during all the days of the kings of Israel and of the kings of Judah;  but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this passover was kept to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.</p> <p>Moreover Josiah put away the mediums, wizards, teraphim, idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he established the words of the law that were written in the book that the priest Hilkiah had found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Before him there was no king like him, who turned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.</p>

 <h3>Paul before Felix at Caesarea</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney, a certain Tertullus, and they reported their case against Paul to the governor.  When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, because of you we have long enjoyed peace, and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight.  We welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude.  But, to detain you no further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.  We have, in fact, found this man a pestilent fellow, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.  He even tried to profane the temple, and so we seized him.  By examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him.”</p> <p>The Jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true.</p> <h3>Paul’s Defense before Felix</h3>
<p>When the governor motioned to him to speak, Paul replied:</p>
<p>“I cheerfully make my defense, knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation.  As you can find out, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.  They did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city.  Neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me.  But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our ancestors, believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets.  I have a hope in God—a hope that they themselves also accept—that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.  Therefore I do my best always to have a clear conscience toward God and all people.  Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices.  While I was doing this, they found me in the temple, completing the rite of purification, without any crowd or disturbance.  But there were some Jews from Asia—they ought to be here before you to make an accusation, if they have anything against me.  Or let these men here tell what crime they had found when I stood before the council,  unless it was this one sentence that I called out while standing before them, ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</p> <p>But Felix, who was rather well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing with the comment, “When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.”  Then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody, but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs.</p>
