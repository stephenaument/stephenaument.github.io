<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 24</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Jesus Visits Martha and Mary</h3>
<p>Now as they went on their way, he entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.  She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he was saying.  But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.”  But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things;  there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.”</p>

Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
