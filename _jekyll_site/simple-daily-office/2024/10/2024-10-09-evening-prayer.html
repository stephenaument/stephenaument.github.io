<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>So the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the prophetess Huldah the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; she resided in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter, where they consulted her.  She declared to them, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me,  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I will indeed bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants—all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.  Because they have abandoned me and have made offerings to other gods, so that they have provoked me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.  But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,  because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when you heard how I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring on this place.” They took the message back to the king.</p> <h3>Josiah’s Reformation</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him.  The king went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and with him went all the people of Judah, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to follow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.

 <h3>Paul Sent to Felix the Governor</h3>
<p>Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get ready to leave by nine o’clock tonight for Caesarea with two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen.  Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Felix the governor.”  He wrote a letter to this effect:</p> <p>“Claudius Lysias to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.  This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but when I had learned that he was a Roman citizen, I came with the guard and rescued him.  Since I wanted to know the charge for which they accused him, I had him brought to their council.  I found that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but was charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.  When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.”</p> <p>So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him during the night to Antipatris.  The next day they let the horsemen go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.  When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.  On reading the letter, he asked what province he belonged to, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,  he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered that he be kept under guard in Herod’s headquarters.</p>

in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>

be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
