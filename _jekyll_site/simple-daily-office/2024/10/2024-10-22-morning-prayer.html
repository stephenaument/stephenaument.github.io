<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Mission of the Seventy</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After this the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go.  He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.  Go on your way. See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of wolves.  Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road.  Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to this house!’  And if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that person; but if not, it will return to you.  Remain in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the laborer deserves to be paid. Do not move about from house to house.  Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you;  cure the sick who are there, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’  But whenever you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say,  ‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off in protest against you. Yet know this: the kingdom of God has come near.’  I tell you, on that day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that town.</p> <h3>Woes to Unrepentant Cities</h3>
<p>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  But at the judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.  And you, Capernaum,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">will you be exalted to heaven?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>No, you will be brought down to Hades.</span></p></div> <p>“Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me, and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Splendor and honor and kingly power *</p> <p class="indent">are yours by right, O Lord our God,</p> <p>For you created everything that is, *</p> <p class="indent">and by your will they were created and have their being;</p> <p class="space">And yours by right, O Lamb that was slain, *</p> <p class="indent">for with your blood you have redeemed for God,</p> <p>From every family, language, people, and nation, *</p> <p class="indent">a kingdom of priests to serve our God.</p> <p class="space">And so, to him who sits upon the throne, *</p> <p class="indent">and to Christ the Lamb,</p> <p>Be worship and praise, dominion and splendor, *</p> <p class="indent">for ever and for evermore.</p>
