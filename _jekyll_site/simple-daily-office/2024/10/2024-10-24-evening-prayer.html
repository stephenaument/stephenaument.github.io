<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>End of the Babylonian Captivity</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia so that he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom, and also in a written edict declared:</p> <p>“Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem in Judah.  Any of those among you who are of his people—may their God be with them!—are now permitted to go up to Jerusalem in Judah, and rebuild the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel—he is the God who is in Jerusalem;  and let all survivors, in whatever place they reside, be assisted by the people of their place with silver and gold, with goods and with animals, besides freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.”</p> <p>The heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites—everyone whose spirit God had stirred—got ready to go up and rebuild the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.  All their neighbors aided them with silver vessels, with gold, with goods, with animals, and with valuable gifts, besides all that was freely offered.  King Cyrus himself brought out the vessels of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.  King Cyrus of Persia had them released into the charge of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.  And this was the inventory: gold basins, thirty; silver basins, one thousand; knives, twenty-nine;  gold bowls, thirty; other silver bowls, four hundred ten; other vessels, one thousand;  the total of the gold and silver vessels was five thousand four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar brought up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.</p>

 <p class="chapter-1">And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit;  he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.  Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given authority like the authority of scorpions of the earth.  They were told not to damage the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.  They were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings someone.  And in those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.</p> <p>In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces,  their hair like women’s hair, and their teeth like lions’ teeth;  they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.  They have tails like scorpions, with stingers, and in their tails is their power to harm people for five months.  They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.</p> <p>The first woe has passed. There are still two woes to come.</p>
