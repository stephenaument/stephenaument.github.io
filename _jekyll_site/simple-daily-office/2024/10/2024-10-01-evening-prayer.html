<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Reign of Hezekiah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.  He did what was right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, just as his ancestor David had done.</p> <h3>The Temple Cleansed</h3>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>The Great Passover</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel.  For the king and his officials and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the passover in the second month  (for they could not keep it at its proper time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem).  The plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.  So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed.  So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials, as the king had commanded, saying, “O people of Israel, return to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.  Do not be like your ancestors and your kindred, who were faithless to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God of their ancestors, so that he made them a desolation, as you see.  Do not now be stiff-necked as your ancestors were, but yield yourselves to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and come to his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, so that his fierce anger may turn away from you.  For as you return to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, your kindred and your children will find compassion with their captors, and return to this land. For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.”</p> <p>So the couriers went from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.  Only a few from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.  The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the officials commanded by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the festival of unleavened bread in the second month, a very large assembly.  They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for offering incense they took away and threw into the Wadi Kidron.  They slaughtered the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests dashed the blood that they received from the hands of the Levites.  For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to slaughter the passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to make it holy to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  For a multitude of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “The good <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> pardon all  who set their hearts to seek God, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of their ancestors, even though not in accordance with the sanctuary’s rules of cleanness.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> heard Hezekiah, and healed the people.  The people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the festival of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> day by day, accompanied by loud instruments for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. So the people ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing offerings of well-being and giving thanks to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of their ancestors.</p> <p>Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the festival for another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness.  For King Hezekiah of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the officials gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. The priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.  The whole assembly of Judah, the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the resident aliens who came out of the land of Israel, and the resident aliens who lived in Judah, rejoiced.  There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon son of King David of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.  Then the priests and the Levites stood up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; their prayer came to his holy dwelling in heaven.</p>

 <h3>Paul’s Journey to Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.  When we found a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail.  We came in sight of Cyprus; and leaving it on our left, we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there.  We looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.  When our days there were ended, we left and proceeded on our journey; and all of them, with wives and children, escorted us outside the city. There we knelt down on the beach and prayed  and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</p> <p>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the believers and stayed with them for one day.  The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.  He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.  While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.  He came to us and took Paul’s belt, bound his own feet and hands with it, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”  When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.  Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”  Since he would not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, “The Lord’s will be done.”</p>
