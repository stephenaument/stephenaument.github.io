<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Hezekiah’s Illness</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.”  Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  “Remember now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I implore you, how I have walked before you in faithfulness with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly.  Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him:  “Turn back, and say to Hezekiah prince of my people, Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestor David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; indeed, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David’s sake.”  Then Isaiah said, “Bring a lump of figs. Let them take it and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover.”</p> <p>Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> on the third day?”  Isaiah said, “This is the sign to you from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do the thing that he has promised: the shadow has now advanced ten intervals; shall it retreat ten intervals?”  Hezekiah answered, “It is normal for the shadow to lengthen ten intervals; rather let the shadow retreat ten intervals.”  The prophet Isaiah cried to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he brought the shadow back the ten intervals, by which the sun had declined on the dial of Ahaz.</p> <h3>Envoys from Babylon</h3>
<p>At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.  Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.  Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.”  He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”</p> <p>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”  Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?”</p> <h3>Death of Hezekiah</h3>
<p>The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah, all his power, how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?  Hezekiah slept with his ancestors; and his son Manasseh succeeded him.</p>

 <h3>The True Wisdom of God</h3>
<p>Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish.  But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.  None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  But, as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor the human heart conceived,</span><br>what God has prepared for those who love him”—</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.  For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God.  Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.  And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.</p> <p>Those who are unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to them, and they are unable to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.  Those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For who has known the mind of the Lord<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>so as to instruct him?”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to<br>hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire<br>or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy,<br>forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid,<br>and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy<br>to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus<br>Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Sundays</h3>
<p>Lord God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ triumphed over the powers of death and prepared for us our place in the new Jerusalem: Grant that we, who have this day given thanks for his resurrection, may praise you in that City of which he is the light, and where he lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.

<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>

and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
