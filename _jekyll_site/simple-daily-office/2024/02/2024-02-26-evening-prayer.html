<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>A Call to Repentance</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me in the days of King Josiah: Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and played the whore there?  And I thought, “After she has done all this she will return to me”; but she did not return, and her false sister Judah saw it.  She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce; yet her false sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore.  Because she took her whoredom so lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.  Yet for all this her false sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me: Faithless Israel has shown herself less guilty than false Judah.  Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">Return, faithless Israel,<br><span class="right">says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span><br>I will not look on you in anger,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for I am merciful,</span><br><span class="right">says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>;</span><br>I will not be angry forever.<br>Only acknowledge your guilt,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>that you have rebelled against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God,</span><br>and scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and have not obeyed my voice,</span><br><span class="right">says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</span><br>Return, O faithless children,<br><span class="right">says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for I am your master;</span><br>I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I will bring you to Zion.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.  And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, they shall no longer say, “The ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” It shall not come to mind, or be remembered, or missed; nor shall another one be made.  At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Jerusalem, and they shall no longer stubbornly follow their own evil will.  In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your ancestors for a heritage.</p>

<h3>14. A Song of Pentitence <em class="latin_name">Kyrie Pantokrator</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

<h3>1 Cor 4:8-21</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Quite apart from us you have become kings! Indeed, I wish that you had become kings, so that we might be kings with you!  For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to mortals.  We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.  To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed and beaten and homeless,  and we grow weary from the work of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;  when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.</p> <h3>Fatherly Admonition</h3>
<p>I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.  For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.  I appeal to you, then, be imitators of me.  For this reason I sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, as I teach them everywhere in every church.  But some of you, thinking that I am not coming to you, have become arrogant.  But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.  For the kingdom of God depends not on talk but on power.  What would you prefer? Am I to come to you with a stick, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?</p>
