<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

 <h3>Isaac Blesses Jacob</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called his elder son Esau and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.”  He said, “See, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.  Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me.  Then prepare for me savory food, such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.”</p> <p>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,  Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father say to your brother Esau,  ‘Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food to eat, that I may bless you before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> before I die.’  Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you.  Go to the flock, and get me two choice kids, so that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he likes;  and you shall take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”  But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a man of smooth skin.  Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.”  His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my word, and go, get them for me.”  So he went and got them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved.  Then Rebekah took the best garments of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob;  and she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.  Then she handed the savory food, and the bread that she had prepared, to her son Jacob.</p> <p>So he went in to his father, and said, “My father”; and he said, “Here I am; who are you, my son?”  Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me.”  But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God granted me success.”  Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.”  So Jacob went up to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”  He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.  He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.”  Then he said, “Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son’s game and bless you.” So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.  Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.”  So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Ah, the smell of my son<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>is like the smell of a field that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed.</span><br>May God give you of the dew of heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and of the fatness of the earth,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and plenty of grain and wine.</span><br>Let peoples serve you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and nations bow down to you.</span><br>Be lord over your brothers,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and may your mother’s sons bow down to you.</span><br>Cursed be everyone who curses you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and blessed be everyone who blesses you!”</span></p></div>

 <h3>Jesus the Light of the World</h3>
<p>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”  Then the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.”  Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.  You judge by human standards; I judge no one.  Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is valid; for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.  In your law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is valid.  I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.”  Then they said to him, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”  He spoke these words while he was teaching in the treasury of the temple, but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</p>
