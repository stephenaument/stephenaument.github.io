<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Essence of the Law</h3>
<p>So now, O Israel, what does the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God require of you? Only to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul,  and to keep the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and his decrees that I am commanding you today, for your own well-being.  Although heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, the earth with all that is in it,  yet the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> set his heart in love on your ancestors alone and chose you, their descendants after them, out of all the peoples, as it is today.  Circumcise, then, the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stubborn any longer.  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who is not partial and takes no bribe,  who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and who loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing.  You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.  You shall fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; him alone you shall worship; to him you shall hold fast, and by his name you shall swear.  He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things that your own eyes have seen.  Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons; and now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has made you as numerous as the stars in heaven.</p>

 <h3>Proclaiming Christ Crucified</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom.  For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.  My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,  so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.</p> <h3>The True Wisdom of God</h3>
<p>Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish.  But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.  None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  But, as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor the human heart conceived,</span><br>what God has prepared for those who love him”—</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.  For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God.  Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.  And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.</p>
