<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Esau’s Lost Blessing</h3>
<p>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of his father Isaac, his brother Esau came in from his hunting.  He also prepared savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father sit up and eat of his son’s game, so that you may bless me.”  His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your firstborn son, Esau.”  Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him?—yes, and blessed he shall be!”  When Esau heard his father’s words, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me, me also, father!”  But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.”  Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and look, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”  Isaac answered Esau, “I have already made him your lord, and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?”  Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, father? Bless me, me also, father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</p> <p>Then his father Isaac answered him:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“See, away from the fatness of the earth shall your home be,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and away from the dew of heaven on high.</span><br>By your sword you shall live,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and you shall serve your brother;</span><br>but when you break loose,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you shall break his yoke from your neck.”</span></p></div> <h3>Jacob Escapes Esau’s Fury</h3>
<p>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”  But the words of her elder son Esau were told to Rebekah; so she sent and called her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran,  and stay with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away—  until your brother’s anger against you turns away, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send, and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”</p>

 <h3>Jesus Foretells His Death</h3>
<p>Again he said to them, “I am going away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”  Then the Jews said, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that what he means by saying, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”  He said to them, “You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.  I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.”  They said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Why do I speak to you at all?  I have much to say about you and much to condemn; but the one who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.”  They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.  So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own, but I speak these things as the Father instructed me.  And the one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.”  As he was saying these things, many believed in him.</p> <h3>True Disciples</h3>
<p>Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, “If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples;  and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”  </p>
