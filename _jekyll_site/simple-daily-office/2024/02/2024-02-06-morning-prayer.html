<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Isaac and Abimelech</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar, to King Abimelech of the Philistines.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; settle in the land that I shall show you.  Reside in this land as an alien, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will fulfill the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.  I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and will give to your offspring all these lands; and all the nations of the earth shall gain blessing for themselves through your offspring,  because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”</p> <p>So Isaac settled in Gerar.  </p>

 <p>Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in the same year reaped a hundredfold. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed him,  and the man became rich; he prospered more and more until he became very wealthy.  He had possessions of flocks and herds, and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.  (Now the Philistines had stopped up and filled with earth all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham.)  And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us; you have become too powerful for us.”</p> <p>So Isaac departed from there and camped in the valley of Gerar and settled there.  Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham; for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he gave them the names that his father had given them.  But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,  the herders of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herders, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the well Esek, because they contended with him.  Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that one also; so he called it Sitnah.  He moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called it Rehoboth, saying, “Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”</p> <p>From there he went up to Beer-sheba.  And that very night the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham; do not be afraid, for I am with you and will bless you and make your offspring numerous for my servant Abraham’s sake.”  So he built an altar there, called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac’s servants dug a well.</p> <p>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.  Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?”  They said, “We see plainly that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has been with you; so we say, let there be an oath between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you  so that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.  In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths; and Isaac set them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.  That same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well that they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water!”  He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.</p>

 <h3>The Woman Caught in Adultery</h3>
<p class="first-line-none">[[Then each of them went home,  while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.  Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them.  The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them,  they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.  Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”  They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.  When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”  And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground.  When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.  Jesus straightened up and said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”  She said, “No one, sir.” And Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.”]]</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
