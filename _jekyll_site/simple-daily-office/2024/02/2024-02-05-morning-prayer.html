<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Birth and Youth of Esau and Jacob</h3>
<p>These are the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham was the father of Isaac,  and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean.  Isaac prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for his wife, because she was barren; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> granted his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.  The children struggled together within her; and she said, “If it is to be this way, why do I live?” So she went to inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to her,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Two nations are in your womb,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and two peoples born of you shall be divided;</span><br>the one shall be stronger than the other,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the elder shall serve the younger.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb.  The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.  Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p> <p>When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.  Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game; but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p> <h3>Esau Sells His Birthright</h3>
<p>Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.  Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished!” (Therefore he was called Edom.)  Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.”  Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?”  Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>

 <h3>Rivers of Living Water</h3>
<p>On the last day of the festival, the great day, while Jesus was standing there, he cried out, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me,  and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said, ‘Out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water.’”  Now he said this about the Spirit, which believers in him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p> <h3>Division among the People</h3>
<p>When they heard these words, some in the crowd said, “This is really the prophet.”  Others said, “This is the Messiah.” But some asked, “Surely the Messiah does not come from Galilee, does he?  Has not the scripture said that the Messiah is descended from David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”  So there was a division in the crowd because of him.  Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</p> <h3>The Unbelief of Those in Authority</h3>
<p>Then the temple police went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why did you not arrest him?”  The police answered, “Never has anyone spoken like this!”  Then the Pharisees replied, “Surely you have not been deceived too, have you?  Has any one of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?  But this crowd, which does not know the law—they are accursed.”  Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, asked,  “Our law does not judge people without first giving them a hearing to find out what they are doing, does it?”  They replied, “Surely you are not also from Galilee, are you? Search and you will see that no prophet is to arise from Galilee.”</p>
