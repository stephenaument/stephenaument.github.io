<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God thrusts them out before you, do not say to yourself, “It is because of my righteousness that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has brought me in to occupy this land”; it is rather because of the wickedness of these nations that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is dispossessing them before you.  It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to occupy their land; but because of the wickedness of these nations the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is dispossessing them before you, in order to fulfill the promise that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p> <p>Know, then, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is not giving you this good land to occupy because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.  Remember and do not forget how you provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God to wrath in the wilderness; you have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> from the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place.</p> <p>Even at Horeb you provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to wrath, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.  When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God; on them were all the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken to you at the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.  At the end of forty days and forty nights the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Get up, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have been quick to turn from the way that I commanded them; they have cast an image for themselves.”  </p>

 <p>It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,  saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And again,</p>

<p class="first-line-none">And again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Here am I and the children whom God has given me.”</p></div> <p>Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.  For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham.  Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.  Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.</p>

Amen.
