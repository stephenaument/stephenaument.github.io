<h3 class="title">Feb 2 The Presentation Of Our Lord Jesus Christ In The Temple</h3>


<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns deep darkness into the morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the surface of the earth: The Lord is his name.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Future Glory of the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came by the prophet Haggai, saying:  Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say,  Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?  Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; work, for I am with you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear.  For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;  and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.  Beloved, we are Godâ€™s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is.  And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.</p> <p>Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.  Everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.  </p>

by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
