<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Blessings for Obedience</h3>
<p>If you heed these ordinances, by diligently observing them, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will maintain with you the covenant loyalty that he swore to your ancestors;  he will love you, bless you, and multiply you; he will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the issue of your flock, in the land that he swore to your ancestors to give you.  You shall be the most blessed of peoples, with neither sterility nor barrenness among you or your livestock.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will turn away from you every illness; all the dread diseases of Egypt that you experienced, he will not inflict on you, but he will lay them on all who hate you.

 <h3>The Example of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,  looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</p> <p>Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.  In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.  And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children—</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“My child, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or lose heart when you are punished by him;</span><br>for the Lord disciplines those whom he loves,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and chastises every child whom he accepts.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Endure trials for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as children; for what child is there whom a parent does not discipline?  If you do not have that discipline in which all children share, then you are illegitimate and not his children.  Moreover, we had human parents to discipline us, and we respected them. Should we not be even more willing to be subject to the Father of spirits and live?  For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share his holiness.  Now, discipline always seems painful rather than pleasant at the time, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</p> <p>Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,  and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.</p> <h3>Warnings against Rejecting God’s Grace</h3>
<p>Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.  </p>
