<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> Furthermore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “I have seen that this people is indeed a stubborn people.  Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and more numerous than they.”</p> <p>So I turned and went down from the mountain, while the mountain was ablaze; the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.  Then I saw that you had indeed sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, by casting for yourselves an image of a calf; you had been quick to turn from the way that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded you.  So I took hold of the two tablets and flung them from my two hands, smashing them before your eyes.  Then I lay prostrate before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> as before, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the sin you had committed, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by doing what was evil in his sight.  For I was afraid that the anger that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> bore against you was so fierce that he would destroy you. But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> listened to me that time also.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy him, but I interceded also on behalf of Aaron at that same time.  Then I took the sinful thing you had made, the calf, and burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly, until it was reduced to dust; and I threw the dust of it into the stream that runs down the mountain.</p>

<h3>14. A Song of Pentitence <em class="latin_name">Kyrie Pantokrator</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</p> <p>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</p> <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="top-1">I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus,  for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind—  just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you—  so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ.  He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p> <h3>Divisions in the Church</h3>
<p>Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose.  For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers and sisters.  What I mean is that each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”  Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?  I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,  so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.  (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)  For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.</p> <h3>Christ the Power and Wisdom of God</h3>
<p>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”</span></p></div>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *</p> <p class"indent">to go in peace as you have promised;</p> <p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *</p> <p class"indent">whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</p> <p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *</p> <p class"indent">and the glory of your people Israel.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class"indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>

<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>
 <p class="indent">He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
 <p class="indent2">and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
