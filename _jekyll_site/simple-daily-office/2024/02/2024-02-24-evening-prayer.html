<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samuel’s Farewell Address</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to you in all that you have said to me, and have set a king over you.  See, it is the king who leads you now; I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth until this day.  Here I am; testify against me before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you.”  They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from the hand of anyone.”  He said to them, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.”</p>

 <h3>Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders</h3>
<p>From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus, asking the elders of the church to meet him.  When they came to him, he said to them:</p>
<p>“You yourselves know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,  serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, enduring the trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.  I did not shrink from doing anything helpful, proclaiming the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house,  as I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.  And now, as a captive to the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,  except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me.  But I do not count my life of any value to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of God’s grace.</p> <p>“And now I know that none of you, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom, will ever see my face again.  Therefore I declare to you this day that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,  for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.  Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son.  I know that after I have gone, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.  Some even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice the disciples to follow them.  Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears.  And now I commend you to God and to the message of his grace, a message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all who are sanctified.  I coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothing.  You know for yourselves that I worked with my own hands to support myself and my companions.  In all this I have given you an example that by such work we must support the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, for he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
