<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> And when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and occupy the land that I have given you,” you rebelled against the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, neither trusting him nor obeying him.  You have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> as long as he has known you.</p> <p>Throughout the forty days and forty nights that I lay prostrate before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> intended to destroy you,  I prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, do not destroy the people who are your very own possession, whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin,  otherwise the land from which you have brought us might say, ‘Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to let them die in the wilderness.’  For they are the people of your very own possession, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”</p> <h3>The Second Pair of Tablets</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">At that time the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood.  I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you smashed, and you shall put them in the ark.”  So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.  Then he wrote on the tablets the same words as before, the ten commandments that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them to me.  So I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark that I had made; and there they are, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded me.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <p class="first-line-none">Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?  For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe.  For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom,  but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,  but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.  For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.</p> <p>Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.  But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;  God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are,  so that no one might boast in the presence of God.  He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,  in order that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</p>
