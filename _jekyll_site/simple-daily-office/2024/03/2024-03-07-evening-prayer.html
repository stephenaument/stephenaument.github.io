<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Linen Loincloth</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Thus said the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to me, “Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth, and put it on your loins, but do not dip it in water.”  So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and put it on my loins.  And the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me a second time, saying,  “Take the loincloth that you bought and are wearing, and go now to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.”  So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded me.  And after many days the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Go now to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”  Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. But now the loincloth was ruined; it was good for nothing.</p> <p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Just so I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.  This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own will and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing.  For as the loincloth clings to one’s loins, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, in order that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory. But they would not listen.</p>

 <h3>The Rights of an Apostle</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?  If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</p> <p>This is my defense to those who would examine me.  Do we not have the right to our food and drink?  Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?  Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?  Who at any time pays the expenses for doing military service? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not get any of its milk?</p> <p>Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law also say the same?  For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?  Or does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was indeed written for our sake, for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope of a share in the crop.  If we have sown spiritual good among you, is it too much if we reap your material benefits?  If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we still more?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.  Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar?  In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.</p> <p>But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing this so that they may be applied in my case. Indeed, I would rather die than that—no one will deprive me of my ground for boasting!  </p>
