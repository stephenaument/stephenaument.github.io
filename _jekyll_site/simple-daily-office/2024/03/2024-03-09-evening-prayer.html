<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, “Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God?”  then you shall say to them: It is because your ancestors have forsaken me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law;  and because you have behaved worse than your ancestors, for here you are, every one of you, following your stubborn evil will, refusing to listen to me.  Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.</p> <h3>God Will Restore Israel</h3>
<p>Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when it shall no longer be said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of Egypt,”  but “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had driven them.” For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their ancestors.</p> <p>I am now sending for many fishermen, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and they shall catch them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.  For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my presence, nor is their iniquity concealed from my sight.  And I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</p> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, my strength and my stronghold,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>my refuge in the day of trouble,</span><br>to you shall the nations come<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>from the ends of the earth and say:</span><br>Our ancestors have inherited nothing but lies,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>worthless things in which there is no profit.</span><br>Can mortals make for themselves gods?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Such are no gods!</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">“Therefore I am surely going to teach them, this time I am going to teach them my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p>

 <h3>Warnings from Israel’s History</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,  and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,  and all ate the same spiritual food,  and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.  Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they were struck down in the wilderness.</p> <p>Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did.  Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play.”  We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.  We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.  And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.  These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have come.  So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not fall.  No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
