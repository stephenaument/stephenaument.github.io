<h3 class="title">Sunday In The Week Of 3 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">Daniel 9:9,10</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, because we have rebelled against him and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by following his laws which he set before us.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joseph Detains Benjamin</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the top of his sack.  Put my cup, the silver cup, in the top of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him.  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.  When they had gone only a short distance from the city, Joseph said to his steward, “Go, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen my silver cup?  Is it not from this that my lord drinks? Does he not indeed use it for divination? You have done wrong in doing this.’”</p> <p>When he overtook them, he repeated these words to them.  They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!  Look, the money that we found at the top of our sacks, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; why then would we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?  Should it be found with any one of your servants, let him die; moreover the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”  He said, “Even so; in accordance with your words, let it be: he with whom it is found shall become my slave, but the rest of you shall go free.”  Then each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack.  He searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.  At this they tore their clothes. Then each one loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.</p> <p>Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house while he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him.  Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that one such as I can practice divination?”  And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? How can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; here we are then, my lord’s slaves, both we and also the one in whose possession the cup has been found.”  But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the one in whose possession the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <p>“Very truly, I tell you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.  For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself;  and he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.  Do not be astonished at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice  and will come out—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.</p>
