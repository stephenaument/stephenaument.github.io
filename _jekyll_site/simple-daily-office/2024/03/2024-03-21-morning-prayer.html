<div class="citation">Joel 2:13</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and repents of evil.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <p>Seven days passed after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had struck the Nile.</p> <h3>The Second Plague: Frogs</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.  The river shall swarm with frogs; they shall come up into your palace, into your bedchamber and your bed, and into the houses of your officials and of your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.  The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your officials.’”   And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”  So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.  But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought frogs up on the land of Egypt.</p> <p>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to take away the frogs from me and my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  Moses said to Pharaoh, “Kindly tell me when I am to pray for you and for your officials and for your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.”  And he said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “As you say! So that you may know that there is no one like the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God,  the frogs shall leave you and your houses and your officials and your people; they shall be left only in the Nile.”  Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> concerning the frogs that he had brought upon Pharaoh.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did as Moses requested: the frogs died in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.  And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.  But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to them, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</p> <h3>The Third Plague: Gnats</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.’”  And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and gnats came on humans and animals alike; all the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.  The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. There were gnats on both humans and animals.  And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God!” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>The Rich Man</h3>
<p>As he was setting out on a journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.  You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.’”  He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth.”  Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”  When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.</p> <p>Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”  And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”  They were greatly astounded and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”  Jesus looked at them and said, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.”</p> <p>Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”  Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news,  who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.  But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</p>
