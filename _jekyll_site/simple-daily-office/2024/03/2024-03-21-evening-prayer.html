<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Individual Retribution</h3>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals.  And just as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  In those days they shall no longer say:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The parents have eaten sour grapes,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the children’s teeth are set on edge.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But all shall die for their own sins; the teeth of everyone who eats sour grapes shall be set on edge.</p> <h3>A New Covenant</h3>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.  It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, “Know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,” for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.</p>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Now if the ministry of death, chiseled in letters on stone tablets, came in glory so that the people of Israel could not gaze at Moses’ face because of the glory of his face, a glory now set aside,  how much more will the ministry of the Spirit come in glory?  For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, much more does the ministry of justification abound in glory!  Indeed, what once had glory has lost its glory because of the greater glory;  for if what was set aside came through glory, much more has the permanent come in glory!</p> <p>Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness,  not like Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside.  But their minds were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is it set aside.  Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds;  but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.  Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.  And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord, the Spirit.</p>
