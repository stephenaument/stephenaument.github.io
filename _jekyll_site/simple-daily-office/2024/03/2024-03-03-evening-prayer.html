<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<div class="citation">Jer 7:21-34</div>
<h3>Jer 7:21-34</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.  For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.  But this command I gave them, “Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may be well with you.”  Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but, in the stubbornness of their evil will, they walked in their own counsels, and looked backward rather than forward.  From the day that your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day;  yet they did not listen to me, or pay attention, but they stiffened their necks. They did worse than their ancestors did.</p> <p>So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you.  You shall say to them: This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Cut off your hair and throw it away;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>raise a lamentation on the bare heights,</span><br>for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has rejected and forsaken<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the generation that provoked his wrath.</span></p></div> <p>For the people of Judah have done evil in my sight, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; they have set their abominations in the house that is called by my name, defiling it.  And they go on building the high place of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire—which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.  Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter: for they will bury in Topheth until there is no more room.  The corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the animals of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.  And I will bring to an end the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of the bride and bridegroom in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for the land shall become a waste.</p>

 <h3>Life in the Spirit</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.  For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,  so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.  For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.  To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.  For this reason the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law—indeed it cannot,  and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</p> <p>But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.  But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  </p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty God, you know that we have no power in ourselves<br>to help ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies and<br>inwardly in our souls, that we may be defended from all<br>adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil<br>thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; through Jesus<br>Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br>Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

Amen.</p>

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
