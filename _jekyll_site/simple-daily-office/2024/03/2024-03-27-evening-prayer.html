<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>But I call on God as witness against me: it was to spare you that I did not come again to Corinth.  I do not mean to imply that we lord it over your faith; rather, we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand firm in the faith.  So I made up my mind not to make you another painful visit.  For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?  And I wrote as I did, so that when I came, I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice; for I am confident about all of you, that my joy would be the joy of all of you.  For I wrote you out of much distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain, but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</p> <h3>Forgiveness for the Offender</h3>
<p>But if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but to some extent—not to exaggerate it—to all of you.  This punishment by the majority is enough for such a person;  so now instead you should forgive and console him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.  So I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.  I wrote for this reason: to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything.  Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ.  And we do this so that we may not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</p> </div>
