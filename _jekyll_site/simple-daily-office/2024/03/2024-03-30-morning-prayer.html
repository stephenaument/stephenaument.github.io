<h3 class="title">Saturday In Holy Week</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 53:6</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Rest That God Promised</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest is still open, let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it.  For indeed the good news came to us just as to them; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.  For we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“As in my anger I swore,<br>‘They shall not enter my rest,’”</p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">though his works were finished at the foundation of the world.  For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows, “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”  And again in this place it says, “They shall not enter my rest.”  Since therefore it remains open for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,  again he sets a certain day—“today”—saying through David much later, in the words already quoted,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Today, if you hear his voice,<br>do not harden your hearts.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later about another day.  So then, a sabbath rest still remains for the people of God;  for those who enter God’s rest also cease from their labors as God did from his.  Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs.</p> <p>Indeed, the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.  And before him no creature is hidden, but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account.</p> <h3>Jesus the Great High Priest</h3>
<p>Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin.  Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
