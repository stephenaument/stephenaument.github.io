<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Good and the Bad Figs</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. This was after King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem King Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim of Judah, together with the officials of Judah, the artisans, and the smiths, and had brought them to Babylon.  One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”</p> <p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.  I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not pluck them up.  I will give them a heart to know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.</p> <p>But thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt.  I will make them a horror, an evil thing, to all the kingdoms of the earth—a disgrace, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them.  And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they are utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their ancestors.</p>

 <h3>The Gift of Love</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p> <p>Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant  or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;  it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p> <p>Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end.  For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part;  but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways.  For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.  And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
