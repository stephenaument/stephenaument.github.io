<h3 class="title">Monday In The Week Of 5 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">Daniel 9:9,10</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, because we have rebelled against him and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by following his laws which he set before us.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>But Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “O my Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor even now that you have spoken to your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Who gives speech to mortals? Who makes them mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?  Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to speak.”  But he said, “O my Lord, please send someone else.”  Then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Moses and he said, “What of your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he can speak fluently; even now he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you his heart will be glad.  You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.  He indeed shall speak for you to the people; he shall serve as a mouth for you, and you shall serve as God for him.  Take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.”</p> <h3>Moses Returns to Egypt</h3>
<p>Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me go back to my kindred in Egypt and see whether they are still living.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt; for all those who were seeking your life are dead.”  So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt; and Moses carried the staff of God in his hand.</p> <p>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.  Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Israel is my firstborn son.  I said to you, “Let my son go that he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; now I will kill your firstborn son.’”</p> <p>On the way, at a place where they spent the night, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> met him and tried to kill him.  But Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched Moses’ feet with it, and said, “Truly you are a bridegroom of blood to me!”  So he let him alone. It was then she said, “A bridegroom of blood by circumcision.”</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went; and he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.  Moses told Aaron all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him.  Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites.  Aaron spoke all the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people.  The people believed; and when they heard that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had given heed to the Israelites and that he had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Again Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know it;  for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands, and they will kill him, and three days after being killed, he will rise again.”  But they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him.</p> <h3>Who Is the Greatest?</h3>
<p>Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”  But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest.  He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.”  Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms, he said to them,  “Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”</p> <h3>Another Exorcist</h3>
<p>John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”  But Jesus said, “Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.  Whoever is not against us is for us.  For truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.</p>
