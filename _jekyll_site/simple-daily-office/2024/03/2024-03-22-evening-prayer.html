<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Seventh Plague: Thunder and Hail</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  For this time I will send all my plagues upon you yourself, and upon your officials, and upon your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.  For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.  But this is why I have let you live: to show you my power, and to make my name resound through all the earth.  You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them go.  Tomorrow at this time I will cause the heaviest hail to fall that has ever fallen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.  Send, therefore, and have your livestock and everything that you have in the open field brought to a secure place; every human or animal that is in the open field and is not brought under shelter will die when the hail comes down upon them.’”  Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hurried their slaves and livestock off to a secure place.  Those who did not regard the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> left their slaves and livestock in the open field.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that hail may fall on the whole land of Egypt, on humans and animals and all the plants of the field in the land of Egypt.”  Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent thunder and hail, and fire came down on the earth. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> rained hail on the land of Egypt;  there was hail with fire flashing continually in the midst of it, such heavy hail as had never fallen in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  The hail struck down everything that was in the open field throughout all the land of Egypt, both human and animal; the hail also struck down all the plants of the field, and shattered every tree in the field.  Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.</p> <p>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “This time I have sinned; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.  Pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>! Enough of God’s thunder and hail! I will let you go; you need stay no longer.”  Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s.  But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God.”  (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.  But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.)  So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and stretched out his hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.  But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned once more and hardened his heart, he and his officials.  So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken through Moses.</p>

 <h3>Treasure in Clay Jars</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.  We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God’s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.  And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.  In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.  For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.  For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.  We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;  persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;  always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies.  For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us, but life in you.</p>
