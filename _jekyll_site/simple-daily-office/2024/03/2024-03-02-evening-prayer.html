<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jeremiah Proclaims God’s Judgment on the Nation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  Stand in the gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, all you people of Judah, you that enter these gates to worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and let me dwell with you in this place.  Do not trust in these deceptive words: “This is the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly one with another,  if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt,  then I will dwell with you in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your ancestors forever and ever.</p> <p>Here you are, trusting in deceptive words to no avail.  Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,  and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, “We are safe!”—only to go on doing all these abominations?  Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your sight? You know, I too am watching, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.  And now, because you have done all these things, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,  therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh.  And I will cast you out of my sight, just as I cast out all your kinsfolk, all the offspring of Ephraim.</p>

<h3>9. The First Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Ecce, Deus</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Surely, it is God who saves me; *</p> <p class="indent">I will trust in him and not be afraid.</p> <p>For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *</p> <p class="indent">and he will be my Savior.</p> <p>Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *</p> <p class="indent">from the springs of salvation.</p> <p>And on that day you shall say, *</p> <p class="indent">Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;</p> <p>Make his deeds known among the peoples; *</p> <p class="indent">see that they remember that his Name is exalted.</p> <p>Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *</p> <p class="indent">and this is known in all the world.</p> <p>Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *</p> <p class="indent">for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>1 Cor 7:10-24</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>To the married I give this command—not I but the Lord—that the wife should not separate from her husband  (but if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.</p> <p>To the rest I say—I and not the Lord—that if any believer has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.  And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.  For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.  But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. It is to peace that God has called you.  Wife, for all you know, you might save your husband. Husband, for all you know, you might save your wife.</p> <h3>The Life that the Lord Has Assigned</h3>
<p>However that may be, let each of you lead the life that the Lord has assigned, to which God called you. This is my rule in all the churches.  Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.  Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but obeying the commandments of God is everything.  Let each of you remain in the condition in which you were called.</p> <p>Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of your present condition now more than ever.  For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ.  You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of human masters.  In whatever condition you were called, brothers and sisters, there remain with God.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
