<h3 class="date">March 20, 2024</h3>
<h3 class="title">Wednesday In The Week Of 5 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">1 John 1:8-9</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, but if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Aaron’s Miraculous Rod</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron,  “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a wonder,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a snake.’”  So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded; Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.  Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts.  Each one threw down his staff, and they became snakes; but Aaron’s staff swallowed up theirs.  Still Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</p> <h3>The First Plague: Water Turned to Blood</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.  Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; stand by at the river bank to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was turned into a snake.  Say to him, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you to say, “Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness.” But until now you have not listened.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “By this you shall know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” See, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and it shall be turned to blood.  The fish in the river shall die, the river itself shall stink, and the Egyptians shall be unable to drink water from the Nile.’”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over its rivers, its canals, and its ponds, and all its pools of water—so that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout the whole land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”</p> <p>Moses and Aaron did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and of his officials he lifted up the staff and struck the water in the river, and all the water in the river was turned into blood,  and the fish in the river died. The river stank so that the Egyptians could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout the whole land of Egypt.  But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts; so Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.  Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.  And all the Egyptians had to dig along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the river.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>Teaching about Divorce</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">He left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan. And crowds again gathered around him; and, as was his custom, he again taught them.</p> <p>Some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”  He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”  They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.”  But Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you.  But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’  ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,  and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.  Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</p> <p>Then in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.  He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her;  and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”</p> <h3>Jesus Blesses Little Children</h3>
<p>People were bringing little children to him in order that he might touch them; and the disciples spoke sternly to them.  But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.  Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.”  And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.</p>
