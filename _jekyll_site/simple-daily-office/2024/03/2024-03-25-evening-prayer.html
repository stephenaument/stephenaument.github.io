<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h3>


  <h3>Psalm 69</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Save me, O God, *</p><p class="indent">for the waters have risen up to my neck.</p><p class="space">I am sinking in deep mire, *</p><p class="indent">and there is no firm ground for my feet.</p><p class="space">I have come into deep waters, *</p><p class="indent">and the torrent washes over me.</p><p class="space">I have grown weary with my crying;</p><p>my throat is inflamed; *</p><p class="indent">my eyes have failed from looking for my God.</p><p class="space">Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;</p><p>my lying foes who would destroy me are mighty. *</p><p class="indent">Must I then give back what I never stole?</p><p class="space">O God, you know my foolishness, *</p><p class="indent">and my faults are not hidden from you.</p><p class="space">Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, Lord GOD of hosts; *</p><p class="indent">let not those who seek you be disgraced because of me, O God of Israel.</p><p>Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, *</p><p class="indent">and shame has covered my face.</p><p class="space">I have become a stranger to my own kindred, *</p><p class="indent">an alien to my mother's children.</p><p class="space">Zeal for your house has eaten me up; *</p><p class="indent">the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.</p><p class="space">I humbled myself with fasting, *</p><p class="indent">but that was turned to my reproach.</p><p class="space">I put on sack-cloth also, *</p><p class="indent">and became a byword among them.</p><p class="space">Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, *</p><p class="indent">and the drunkards make songs about me.</p><p class="space">But as for me, this is my prayer to you, *</p><p class="indent">at the time you have set, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>:</p><p class="space">"In your great mercy, O God, *</p><p class="indent">answer me with your unfailing help.</p><p class="space">Save me from the mire;

*</p><p class="indent">do not let the Pit shut its mouth upon me.</p><p class="space">Answer me, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for your love is kind; *</p><p class="indent">in your great compassion, turn to me."</p><p>"Hide not your face from your servant;

*</p><p class="indent">my adversaries are all in your sight."</p><p>Reproach has broken my heart, and it cannot be healed; *</p><p class="indent">I looked for sympathy, but there was none,</p><p class="indent">for comforters, but I could find no one.</p><p class="space">They gave me gall to eat, *</p><p class="indent">and when I was thirsty, they gave me vinegar to drink.</p><p class="space">Let the table before them be a trap *</p><p class="indent">and their sacred feasts a snare.</p><p class="space">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, *</p><p class="indent">and give them continual trembling in their loins.</p><p class="space">Pour out your indignation upon them, *</p><p class="indent">and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.</p><p class="space">Let their camp be desolate, *</p><p class="indent">and let there be none to dwell in their tents.</p><p class="space">For they persecute him whom you have stricken *</p><p class="indent">and add to the pain of those whom you have pierced.</p><p class="space">Lay to their charge guilt upon guilt, *</p><p class="indent">and let them not receive your vindication.</p><p class="space">Let them be wiped out of the book of the living *</p><p class="indent">and not be written among the righteous.</p><p class="space">As for me, I am afflicted and in pain; *</p><p class="indent">your help, O God, will lift me up on high.</p><p class="space">I will praise the Name of God in song; *</p><p class="indent">I will proclaim his greatness with thanksgiving.</p><p class="space">This will please the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> more than an offering of oxen, *</p><p class="indent">more than bullocks with horns and hoofs.</p><p>The afflicted shall see and be glad; *</p><p class="indent">you who seek God, your heart shall live.</p><p class="space">For the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> listens to the needy, *</p><p class="indent">and his prisoners he does not despise.</p><p class="space">Let the heavens and the earth praise him, *</p><p class="indent">the seas and all that moves in them;</p><p class="space">For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah;

<p>To the church of God that is in Corinth, including all the saints throughout Achaia:</p> <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <h3>Paul’s Thanksgiving after Affliction</h3>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation,  who consoles us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to console those who are in any affliction with the consolation with which we ourselves are consoled by God.  For just as the sufferings of Christ are abundant for us, so also our consolation is abundant through Christ.  If we are being afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation; if we are being consoled, it is for your consolation, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering.  Our hope for you is unshaken; for we know that as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our consolation.</p>

<p><p>Almighty God, whose dear Son went not up to joy but<br>first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he<br>was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way<br>of the cross, may find it none other that the way of life and<br>peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives<br>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br>and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Peace</h3>
<p>Most holy God, the source of all good desires, all right judgments, and all just works: Give to us, your servants, that peace which the world cannot give, so that our minds may be fixed on the doing of your will, and that we, being delivered from the fear of all enemies, may live in peace and quietness; through the mercies of Christ Jesus our Savior. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.
