<div class="citation">Luke 15:18,19</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Seventh Plague: Thunder and Hail</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  For this time I will send all my plagues upon you yourself, and upon your officials, and upon your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.  For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.  But this is why I have let you live: to show you my power, and to make my name resound through all the earth.  You are still exalting yourself against my people, and will not let them go.  Tomorrow at this time I will cause the heaviest hail to fall that has ever fallen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.  Send, therefore, and have your livestock and everything that you have in the open field brought to a secure place; every human or animal that is in the open field and is not brought under shelter will die when the hail comes down upon them.’”  Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hurried their slaves and livestock off to a secure place.  Those who did not regard the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> left their slaves and livestock in the open field.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven so that hail may fall on the whole land of Egypt, on humans and animals and all the plants of the field in the land of Egypt.”  Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent thunder and hail, and fire came down on the earth. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> rained hail on the land of Egypt;  there was hail with fire flashing continually in the midst of it, such heavy hail as had never fallen in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.  The hail struck down everything that was in the open field throughout all the land of Egypt, both human and animal; the hail also struck down all the plants of the field, and shattered every tree in the field.  Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, there was no hail.</p> <p>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “This time I have sinned; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.  Pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>! Enough of God’s thunder and hail! I will let you go; you need stay no longer.”  Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will stretch out my hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s.  But as for you and your officials, I know that you do not yet fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God.”  (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.  But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they are late in coming up.)  So Moses left Pharaoh, went out of the city, and stretched out his hands to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.  But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned once more and hardened his heart, he and his officials.  So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken through Moses.</p>

  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>A Third Time Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him,  saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death; then they will hand him over to the Gentiles;  they will mock him, and spit upon him, and flog him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise again.”</p> <h3>The Request of James and John</h3>
<p>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”  And he said to them, “What is it you want me to do for you?”  And they said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”  But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”  They replied, “We are able.” Then Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;  but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</p> <p>When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John.  So Jesus called them and said to them, “You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them.  But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant,  and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.  For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”</p>
