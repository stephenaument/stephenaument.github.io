<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Anointed King of Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After this David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Go up.” David said, “To which shall I go up?” He said, “To Hebron.”  So David went up there, along with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.  David brought up the men who were with him, every one with his household; and they settled in the towns of Hebron.  Then the people of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.</p>
<p>When they told David, “It was the people of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,”  David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord, and buried him!  Now may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> show steadfast love and faithfulness to you! And I too will reward you because you have done this thing.  Therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”</p> <h3>Ishbaal King of Israel</h3>
<p>But Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbaal son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim.  He made him king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and over all Israel.  Ishbaal, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.  The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p>

Greet also the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert in Asia for Christ.  Greet Mary, who has worked very hard among you.

<p><p>O God, the protector of all who trust in you, without whom<br>nothing is strong, nothing is holy: Increase and multiply upon<br>us your mercy; that, with you as our ruler and guide, we may<br>so pass through things temporal, that we lose not the things<br>eternal; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns<br>with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.<br><em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<p>Most holy God, the source of all good desires, all right judgments, and all just works: Give to us, your servants, that peace which the world cannot give, so that our minds may be fixed on the doing of your will, and that we, being delivered from the fear of all enemies, may live in peace and quietness; through the mercies of Christ Jesus our Savior. Amen.</p>

Amen.
