<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Plays the Lyre for Saul</h3>
<p>Now the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> tormented him.  And Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.  Let our lord now command the servants who attend you to look for someone who is skillful in playing the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will feel better.”  So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me someone who can play well, and bring him to me.”  One of the young men answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is with him.”  So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David who is with the sheep.”  Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them by his son David to Saul.  And David came to Saul, and entered his service. Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.  Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”  And whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand, and Saul would be relieved and feel better, and the evil spirit would depart from him.</p> <h3>David and Goliath</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.  Saul and the Israelites gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and formed ranks against the Philistines.  The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.  And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.  He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.  He had greaves of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.  The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his shield-bearer went before him.  He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.  If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.”  And the Philistine said, “Today I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man, that we may fight together.”  When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>God’s Wrath and Mercy</h3>
<p>You will say to me then, “Why then does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?”  But who indeed are you, a human being, to argue with God? Will what is molded say to the one who molds it, “Why have you made me like this?”  Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use?  What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction;  and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory—  including us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?  As indeed he says in Hosea,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”</span><br>“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there they shall be called children of the living God.”</span></p></div> <p>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Though the number of the children of Israel were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved;  for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively.”  And as Isaiah predicted,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“If the Lord of hosts had not left survivors to us,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>we would have fared like Sodom</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and been made like Gomorrah.”</span></p></div> <h3>Israel’s Unbelief</h3>
<p>What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;  but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.  Why not? Because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,  as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“See, I am laying in Zion a stone that will make people stumble, a rock that will make them fall,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”</span></p></div>
