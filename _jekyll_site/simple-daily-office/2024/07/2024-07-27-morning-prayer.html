<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joshua Exhorts the People</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">A long time afterward, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had given rest to Israel from all their enemies all around, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,  Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders and heads, their judges and officers, and said to them, “I am now old and well advanced in years;  and you have seen all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God who has fought for you.  I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will push them back before you, and drive them out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God promised you.  Therefore be very steadfast to observe and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right nor to the left,  so that you may not be mixed with these nations left here among you, or make mention of the names of their gods, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow yourselves down to them,  but hold fast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, as you have done to this day.  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, no one has been able to withstand you to this day.  One of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God who fights for you, as he promised you.  Be very careful, therefore, to love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  For if you turn back, and join the survivors of these nations left here among you, and intermarry with them, so that you marry their women and they yours,  know assuredly that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will not continue to drive out these nations before you; but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a scourge on your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given you.</p> <p>“And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one thing has failed of all the good things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God promised concerning you; all have come to pass for you, not one of them has failed.  But just as all the good things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will bring upon you all the bad things, until he has destroyed you from this good land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given you.  If you transgress the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, which he enjoined on you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you.”</p>

 <h3>Pilate Questions Jesus</h3>
<p>Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.”  But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not answer.  Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many accusations they make against you?”  But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p> <h3>Barabbas or Jesus?</h3>
<p>Now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd, anyone whom they wanted.  At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Jesus Barabbas.  So after they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”  For he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over.  While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him.”  Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.  The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”  Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” All of them said, “Let him be crucified!”  Then he asked, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”</p>

<p><p>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our<br>necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have<br>compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those<br>things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our<br>blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son<br>Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Saturdays</h3>
<p>Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested from all your works and sanctified a day of rest for all your creatures: Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties, may be duly prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and that our rest here upon earth may be a preparation for the eternal rest promised to your people in heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.
</p>


<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
