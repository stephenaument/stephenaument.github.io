<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>At that time, I charged you as follows: “Although the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given you this land to occupy, all your troops shall cross over armed as the vanguard of your Israelite kin.  Only your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—shall stay behind in the towns that I have given to you.  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives rest to your kindred, as to you, and they too have occupied the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving them beyond the Jordan, then each of you may return to the property that I have given to you.”  And I charged Joshua as well at that time, saying: “Your own eyes have seen everything that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has done to these two kings; so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.

Let me cross over to see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and the Lebanon.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with me on your account and would not heed me. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Enough from you! Never speak to me of this matter again!  Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you to the west, to the north, to the south, and to the east. Look well, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.  But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, because it is he who shall cross over at the head of this people and who shall secure their possession of the land that you will see.”  </p>

 <h3>The Destruction of the Temple Foretold</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">As Jesus came out of the temple and was going away, his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.  Then he asked them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.”</p> <h3>Signs of the End of the Age</h3>
<p>When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”  Jesus answered them, “Beware that no one leads you astray.  For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah!’ and they will lead many astray.  And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet.  For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places:  all this is but the beginning of the birth pangs.</p> <h3>Persecutions Foretold</h3>
<p>“Then they will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.  Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another.  And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.  And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold.  But the one who endures to the end will be saved.  And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come.</p>
