<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Ehud</h3>
<p>The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> strengthened King Eglon of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  In alliance with the Ammonites and the Amalekites, he went and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms.  So the Israelites served King Eglon of Moab eighteen years.</p> <p>But when the Israelites cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The Israelites sent tribute by him to King Eglon of Moab.  Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length; and he fastened it on his right thigh under his clothes.  Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.  When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent the people who carried the tribute on their way.  But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” So the king said, “Silence!” and all his attendants went out from his presence.  Ehud came to him, while he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber, and said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he rose from his seat.  Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon’s belly;  the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.  Then Ehud went out into the vestibule, and closed the doors of the roof chamber on him, and locked them.</p> <p>After he had gone, the servants came. When they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, “He must be relieving himself in the cool chamber.”  So they waited until they were embarrassed. When he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them. There was their lord lying dead on the floor.</p> <p>Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured stones, and escaped to Seirah.  When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head.  He said to them, “Follow after me; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him, and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and allowed no one to cross over.  At that time they killed about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; no one escaped.  So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</p>

 <h3>The Death of Jesus</h3>
<p>From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.  And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.”  At once one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink.  But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”  Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last.  At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.  The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  After his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many.  Now when the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</p>
