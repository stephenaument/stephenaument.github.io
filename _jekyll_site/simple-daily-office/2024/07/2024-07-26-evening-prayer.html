<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Death of Saul and His Sons</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and many fell on Mount Gilboa.  The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.  The battle pressed hard upon Saul; the archers found him, and he was badly wounded by them.  Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, so that these uncircumcised may not come and thrust me through, and make sport of me.” But his armor-bearer was unwilling; for he was terrified. So Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.  When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.  So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together on the same day.  When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their towns and fled; and the Philistines came and occupied them.</p> <p>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.  They cut off his head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to the houses of their idols and to the people.  They put his armor in the temple of Astarte; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.  But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,  all the valiant men set out, traveled all night long, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. They came to Jabesh and burned them there.  Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>

 <h3>Paul’s Reason for Writing So Boldly</h3>
<p>I myself feel confident about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.  Nevertheless on some points I have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God  to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.  In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast of my work for God.  For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed,  by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far around as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ.  Thus I make it my ambition to proclaim the good news, not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on someone else’s foundation,  but as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Those who have never been told of him shall see,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and those who have never heard of him shall understand.”</span></p></div> <h3>Paul’s Plan to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>This is the reason that I have so often been hindered from coming to you.  But now, with no further place for me in these regions, I desire, as I have for many years, to come to you  when I go to Spain. For I do hope to see you on my journey and to be sent on by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a little while.  </p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our<br>necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have<br>compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those<br>things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our<br>blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son<br>Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Fridays</h3>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>O God, you manifest in your servants the signs of your presence: Send forth upon us the Spirit of love, that in companionship with one another your abounding grace may increase among us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
