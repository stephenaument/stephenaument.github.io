<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Saul Defeats the Amalekites but Spares Their King</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Samuel said to Saul, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did in opposing the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.  Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”</p>

<p> Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.  He took King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the cattle and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was valuable, and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless they utterly destroyed.</p> <h3>Saul Rejected as King</h3>
<p>The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Samuel:  “I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not carried out my commands.” Samuel was angry; and he cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> all night.  Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, and Samuel was told, “Saul went to Carmel, where he set up a monument for himself, and on returning he passed on down to Gilgal.”  When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “May you be blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; I have carried out the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of cattle that I hear?”  Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the cattle, to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed.”  Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! I will tell you what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me last night.” He replied, “Speak.”</p> <p>Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> anointed you king over Israel.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go, utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’  Why then did you not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>? Why did you swoop down on the spoil, and do what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?”  Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I have gone on the mission on which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent me, I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  But from the spoil the people took sheep and cattle, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God in Gilgal.”  And Samuel said,</p>

 <p>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.  And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</p> <p>We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family.  And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>
