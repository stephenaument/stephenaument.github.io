<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Balak Summons Balaam to Curse Israel</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The Israelites set out, and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.  Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.  Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were so numerous; Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.  And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.  He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is on the Euphrates, in the land of Amaw, to summon him, saying, “A people has come out of Egypt; they have spread over the face of the earth, and they have settled next to me.  Come now, curse this people for me, since they are stronger than I; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed.”</p> <p>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and gave him Balak’s message.  He said to them, “Stay here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> speaks to me”; so the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam.  God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”  Balaam said to God, “King Balak son of Zippor of Moab, has sent me this message:  ‘A people has come out of Egypt and has spread over the face of the earth; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”  God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”  So Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the officials of Balak, “Go to your own land, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has refused to let me go with you.”  So the officials of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”</p> <p>Once again Balak sent officials, more numerous and more distinguished than these.  They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor: ‘Do not let anything hinder you from coming to me;  for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do; come, curse this people for me.’”  But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Although Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, to do less or more.  You remain here, as the others did, so that I may learn what more the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> may say to me.”  That night God came to Balaam and said to him, “If the men have come to summon you, get up and go with them; but do only what I tell you to do.”  So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3>
<p>Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.  He said to them, “It is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but you are making it a den of robbers.”</span></p></div> <p>The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.  But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did, and heard the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became angry  and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you have prepared praise for yourself’?”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">He left them, went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.</p> <h3>Jesus Curses the Fig Tree</h3>
<p>In the morning, when he returned to the city, he was hungry.  And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road, he went to it and found nothing at all on it but leaves. Then he said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once.  When the disciples saw it, they were amazed, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”  Jesus answered them, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will be done.  Whatever you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive.”</p>
