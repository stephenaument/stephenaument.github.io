<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him; as a result, Saul set him over the army. And all the people, even the servants of Saul, approved.</p> <p>As they were coming home, when David returned from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the towns of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.  And the women sang to one another as they made merry,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Saul has killed his thousands,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and David his ten thousands.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Saul was very angry, for this saying displeased him. He said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; what more can he have but the kingdom?”  So Saul eyed David from that day on.</p> <h3>Saul Tries to Kill David</h3>
<p>The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;  and Saul threw the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice.</p> <p>Saul was afraid of David, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with him but had departed from Saul.  So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of a thousand; and David marched out and came in, leading the army.  David had success in all his undertakings; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with him.  When Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of him.  But all Israel and Judah loved David; for it was he who marched out and came in leading them.</p>

<p> David rose and went, along with his men, and killed one hundred of the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Saul gave him his daughter Michal as a wife.  But when Saul realized that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with David, and that Saul’s daughter Michal loved him,  Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy from that time forward.</p> <p>Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle; and as often as they came out, David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his fame became very great.</p>

 <h3>Israel’s Rejection Is Not Final</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.  God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?  “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”  But what is the divine reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”  So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.  But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</p> <p>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,  as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“God gave them a sluggish spirit,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>eyes that would not see</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and ears that would not hear,</span><br>down to this very day.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And David says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Let their table become a snare and a trap,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</span><br>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and keep their backs forever bent.”</span></p></div> <h3>The Salvation of the Gentiles</h3>
<p>So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.  Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</p>
