<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Israel’s Disobedience</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, “I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you into the land that I had promised to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you.  For your part, do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed my command. See what you have done!  So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become adversaries to you, and their gods shall be a snare to you.”  When the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept.  So they named that place Bochim, and there they sacrificed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>Israel’s Unfaithfulness</h3>
<p>Then the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and worshiped the Baals;  and they abandoned the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were all around them, and bowed down to them; and they provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to anger.  They abandoned the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and worshiped Baal and the Astartes.  So the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers who plundered them, and he sold them into the power of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.  Whenever they marched out, the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was against them to bring misfortune, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had warned them and sworn to them; and they were in great distress.</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised up judges, who delivered them out of the power of those who plundered them.  Yet they did not listen even to their judges; for they lusted after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their ancestors had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; they did not follow their example.  Whenever the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> raised up judges for them, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with the judge, and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> would be moved to pity by their groaning because of those who persecuted and oppressed them.  But whenever the judge died, they would relapse and behave worse than their ancestors, following other gods, worshiping them and bowing down to them. They would not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.  So the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel; and he said, “Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors, and have not obeyed my voice,  I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.”  In order to test Israel, whether or not they would take care to walk in the way of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> as their ancestors did,  the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had left those nations, not driving them out at once, and had not handed them over to Joshua.</p>

 <h3>The Crucifixion of Jesus</h3>
<p>As they went out, they came upon a man from Cyrene named Simon; they compelled this man to carry his cross.  And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),  they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.  And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots;  then they sat down there and kept watch over him.  Over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”</p> <p>Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.  Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads  and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”  In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,  “He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.  He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”  The bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.</p>
