<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joshua Renews the Covenant</h3>
<p>Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel,  just as Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, “an altar of unhewn stones, on which no iron tool has been used”; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and sacrificed offerings of well-being.  And there, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.  All Israel, alien as well as citizen, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark in front of the levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.  And afterward he read all the words of the law, blessings and curses, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the aliens who resided among them.</p>

 <h3>Jesus before the High Priest</h3>
<p>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered.  But Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and going inside, he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end.  Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death,  but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward  and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.’”  The high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?”  But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”  Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you,</p>

Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.  What is your verdict?” They answered, “He deserves death.”  Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him,  saying, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?”</p>
