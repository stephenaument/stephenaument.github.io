<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 8</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Balaam’s Third Oracle</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now Balaam saw that it pleased the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to bless Israel, so he did not go, as at other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.  Balaam looked up and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe. Then the spirit of God came upon him,  and he uttered his oracle, saying:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the oracle of the man whose eye is clear,</span><br>the oracle of one who hears the words of God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>who sees the vision of the Almighty,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>who falls down, but with eyes uncovered:</span><br>how fair are your tents, O Jacob,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>your encampments, O Israel!</span><br>Like palm groves that stretch far away,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>like gardens beside a river,</span><br>like aloes that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has planted,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>like cedar trees beside the waters.</span><br>Water shall flow from his buckets,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his seed shall have abundant water,</span><br>his king shall be higher than Agag,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his kingdom shall be exalted.</span><br>God who brings him out of Egypt,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>is like the horns of a wild ox for him;</span><br>he shall devour the nations that are his foes<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and break their bones.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>He shall strike with his arrows.</span><br>He crouched, he lay down like a lion,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and like a lioness; who will rouse him up?</span><br>Blessed is everyone who blesses you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and cursed is everyone who curses you.”</span></p></div> <p>Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but instead you have blessed them these three times.  Now be off with you! Go home! I said, ‘I will reward you richly,’ but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has denied you any reward.”  And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,  ‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to do either good or bad of my own will; what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> says, that is what I will say’?  </p>

 <h3>The Question about Paying Taxes</h3>
<p>Then the Pharisees went and plotted to entrap him in what he said.  So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality.  Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?”  But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites?  Show me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius.  Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?”  They answered, “The emperor’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”  When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away.</p>

<p><p>Almighty God, you have built your Church upon the<br>foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself<br>being the chief cornerstone: Grant us so to be joined together<br>in unity of spirit by their teaching, that we may be made a<br>holy temple acceptable to you; through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God,<br>for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.

We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
