<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Paul Preaches in Rome</h3>
<p>After they had set a day to meet with him, they came to him at his lodgings in great numbers. From morning until evening he explained the matter to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.  Some were convinced by what he had said, while others refused to believe.  So they disagreed with each other; and as they were leaving, Paul made one further statement: “The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah,</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Go to this people and say,<br>You will indeed listen, but never understand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and you will indeed look, but never perceive.</span><br>For this people’s heart has grown dull,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and their ears are hard of hearing,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and they have shut their eyes;</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>so that they might not look with their eyes,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and listen with their ears,</span><br>and understand with their heart and turn—<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I would heal them.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Let it be known to you then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.”</p> <p>He lived there two whole years at his own expense and welcomed all who came to him,  proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.</p>

Amen.
