<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.</p> <h3>Balaam, the Donkey, and the Angel</h3>
<p>God’s anger was kindled because he was going, and the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> took his stand in the road as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him.  The donkey saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand; so the donkey turned off the road, and went into the field; and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn it back onto the road.  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.  When the donkey saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, it scraped against the wall, and scraped Balaam’s foot against the wall; so he struck it again.  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went ahead, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.  When the donkey saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, it lay down under Balaam; and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened the mouth of the donkey, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”  Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a fool of me! I wish I had a sword in my hand! I would kill you right now!”  But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I been in the habit of treating you this way?” And he said, “No.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> standing in the road, with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed down, falling on his face.  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.  The donkey saw me, and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let it live.”  Then Balaam said to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now therefore, if it is displeasing to you, I will return home.”  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but speak only what I tell you to speak.” So Balaam went on with the officials of Balak.</p> <p>When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at Ir-moab, on the boundary formed by the Arnon, at the farthest point of the boundary.  Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?”  Balaam said to Balak, “I have come to you now, but do I have power to say just anything? The word God puts in my mouth, that is what I must say.”  </p>

 <h3>The Authority of Jesus Questioned</h3>
<p>When he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”  Jesus said to them, “I will also ask you one question; if you tell me the answer, then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.  Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin?” And they argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’  But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ we are afraid of the crowd; for all regard John as a prophet.”  So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</p> <h3>The Parable of the Two Sons</h3>
<p>“What do you think? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’  He answered, ‘I will not’; but later he changed his mind and went.  The father went to the second and said the same; and he answered, ‘I go, sir’; but he did not go.  Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.  For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even after you saw it, you did not change your minds and believe him.</p>
