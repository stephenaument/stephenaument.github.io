<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 9</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <p>Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel: “Be strong and bold, for you are the one who will go with this people into the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sworn to their ancestors to give them; and you will put them in possession of it.  It is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”</p> <h3>The Law to Be Read Every Seventh Year</h3>
<p>Then Moses wrote down this law, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and to all the elders of Israel.  Moses commanded them: “Every seventh year, in the scheduled year of remission, during the festival of booths,  when all Israel comes to appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.  Assemble the people—men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing in your towns—so that they may hear and learn to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and to observe diligently all the words of this law,  and so that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.”</p>

 <p>When Moses had finished writing down in a book the words of this law to the very end,  Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying,  “Take this book of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; let it remain there as a witness against you.

If you already have been so rebellious toward the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> while I am still alive among you, how much more after my death!  Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may recite these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.

 <h3>The Desolating Sacrilege</h3>
<p>“So when you see the desolating sacrilege standing in the holy place, as was spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand),  then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;  the one on the housetop must not go down to take what is in the house;  the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.  Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!  Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath.  For at that time there will be great suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.  And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.  Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Messiah!’ or ‘There he is!’—do not believe it.  For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.  Take note, I have told you beforehand.  So, if they say to you, ‘Look! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look! He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.  For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.  Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</p> <h3>The Coming of the Son of Man</h3>
<p>“Immediately after the suffering of those days</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">the sun will be darkened,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the moon will not give its light;</span><br>the stars will fall from heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the powers of heaven will be shaken.</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see ‘the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven’ with power and great glory.  And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
