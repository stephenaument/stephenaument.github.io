<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 11</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Joshua summoned them, and said to them, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ while in fact you are living among us?  Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”  They answered Joshua, “Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; so we were in great fear for our lives because of you, and did this thing.  And now we are in your hand: do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.”  This is what he did for them: he saved them from the Israelites; and they did not kill them.  But on that day Joshua made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to continue to this day, in the place that he should choose.</p> <h3>The Sun Stands Still</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,  he became greatly frightened, because Gibeon was a large city, like one of the royal cities, and was larger than Ai, and all its men were warriors.  So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent a message to King Hoham of Hebron, to King Piram of Jarmuth, to King Japhia of Lachish, and to King Debir of Eglon, saying,  “Come up and help me, and let us attack Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the Israelites.”  Then the five kings of the Amorites—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon—gathered their forces, and went up with all their armies and camped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</p> <p>And the Gibeonites sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country are gathered against us.”  So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the fighting force with him, all the mighty warriors.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have handed them over to you; not one of them shall stand before you.”  So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> threw them into a panic before Israel, who inflicted a great slaughter on them at Gibeon, chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.  As they fled before Israel, while they were going down the slope of Beth-horon, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> threw down huge stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died because of the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword.</p> <p>On the day when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he said in the sight of Israel,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Sun, stand still at Gibeon,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.”</span><br>And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in midheaven, and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.  There has been no day like it before or since, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> heeded a human voice; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> fought for Israel.</p> <p>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Jesus Brought before Pilate</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus in order to bring about his death.  They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</p> <h3>The Suicide of Judas</h3>
<p>When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.  He said, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.”  Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.  But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.”  After conferring together, they used them to buy the potter’s field as a place to bury foreigners.  For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.  Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the people of Israel had set a price,  and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”</p>
