<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Saul Proclaimed King</h3>
<p>Samuel summoned the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Mizpah  and said to them, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’  But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said, ‘No! but set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by your tribes and by your clans.”</p> <p>Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.  He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of the Matrites was taken by lot. Finally he brought the family of the Matrites near man by man, and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.  So they inquired again of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Did the man come here?” and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “See, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”  Then they ran and brought him from there. When he took his stand among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.  Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”</p> <p>Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship; and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Then Samuel sent all the people back to their homes.  Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went warriors whose hearts God had touched.  But some worthless fellows said, “How can this man save us?” They despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.</p>
<p>Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead.</p>

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Therefore, do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.  No longer present your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and present your members to God as instruments of righteousness.  For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</p> <h3>Slaves of Righteousness</h3>
<p>What then? Should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!  Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?  But thanks be to God that you, having once been slaves of sin, have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted,  and that you, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.  I am speaking in human terms because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification.</p> <p>When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.  So what advantage did you then get from the things of which you now are ashamed? The end of those things is death.  But now that you have been freed from sin and enslaved to God, the advantage you get is sanctification. The end is eternal life.  For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
