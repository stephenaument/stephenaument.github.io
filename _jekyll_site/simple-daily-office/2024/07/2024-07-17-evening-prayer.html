<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Friendship of David and Jonathan</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came before Jonathan and said, “What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin against your father that he is trying to take my life?”  He said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me; and why should my father hide this from me? Never!”  But David also swore, “Your father knows well that you like me; and he thinks, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.’ But truly, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.”  Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”  David said to Jonathan, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at the meal; but let me go, so that I may hide in the field until the third evening.  If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’  If he says, ‘Good!’ it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then know that evil has been determined by him.  Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself; why should you bring me to your father?”  Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! If I knew that it was decided by my father that evil should come upon you, would I not tell you?”  Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”  Jonathan replied to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So they both went out into the field.</p> <p>Jonathan said to David, “By the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel! When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or on the third day, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?  But if my father intends to do you harm, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> do so to Jonathan, and more also, if I do not disclose it to you, and send you away, so that you may go in safety. May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> be with you, as he has been with my father.  If I am still alive, show me the faithful love of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but if I die,  never cut off your faithful love from my house, even if the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> were to cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”  Thus Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> seek out the enemies of David.”  Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him; for he loved him as he loved his own life.</p> <p>Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon; you will be missed, because your place will be empty.  On the day after tomorrow, you shall go a long way down; go to the place where you hid yourself earlier, and remain beside the stone there.  I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.  Then I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, collect them,’ then you are to come, for, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.  But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent you away.  As for the matter about which you and I have spoken, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is witness between you and me forever.”</p>

 <h3>All Israel Will Be Saved</h3>
<p>So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.  And so all Israel will be saved; as it is written,</p>

Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,  so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.  For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.</p> <p>O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For who has known the mind of the Lord?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Or who has been his counselor?”</span><br>“Or who has given a gift to him,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>to receive a gift in return?”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For from him and through him and to him are all things.
