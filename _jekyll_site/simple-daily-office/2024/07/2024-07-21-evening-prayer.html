<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, “God has given him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.”  Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.  When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to the priest Abiathar, “Bring the ephod here.”  David said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, your servant has heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.  And now, will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “He will come down.”  Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “They will surrender you.”  Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they wandered wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.  David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did not give him into his hand.</p> <h3>David Eludes Saul in the Wilderness</h3>
<p>David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh when he learned that Saul had come out to seek his life.  Saul’s son Jonathan set out and came to David at Horesh; there he strengthened his hand through the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  He said to him, “Do not be afraid; for the hand of my father Saul shall not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you; my father Saul also knows that this is so.”  Then the two of them made a covenant before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.</p>

 <h3>Paul before the Council</h3>
<p>Since he wanted to find out what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet. He brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</p> <p class="chapter-2">While Paul was looking intently at the council he said, “Brothers, up to this day I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God.”  Then the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth.  At this Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to judge me according to the law, and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck?”  Those standing nearby said, “Do you dare to insult God’s high priest?”  And Paul said, “I did not realize, brothers, that he was high priest; for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a leader of your people.’”</p> <p>When Paul noticed that some were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he called out in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”  When he said this, a dissension began between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.  (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, or angel, or spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge all three.)  Then a great clamor arose, and certain scribes of the Pharisees’ group stood up and contended, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”  When the dissension became violent, the tribune, fearing that they would tear Paul to pieces, ordered the soldiers to go down, take him by force, and bring him into the barracks.</p> <p>That night the Lord stood near him and said, “Keep up your courage! For just as you have testified for me in Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also in Rome.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our<br>necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have<br>compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those<br>things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our<br>blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son<br>Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Sundays</h3>
<p>Lord God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ triumphed over the powers of death and prepared for us our place in the new Jerusalem: Grant that we, who have this day given thanks for his resurrection, may praise you in that City of which he is the light, and where he lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.
</p>


<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>
  
<p class="poetry">
  
  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
