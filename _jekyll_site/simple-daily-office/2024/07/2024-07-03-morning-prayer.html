<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Balaam’s First Oracle</h3>
<p>On the next day Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal; and from there he could see part of the people of Israel.  Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”  Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.  Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your burnt offerings while I go aside. Perhaps the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” And he went to a bare height.</p> <p>Then God met Balaam; and Balaam said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars, and have offered a bull and a ram on each altar.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and this is what you must say.”  So he returned to Balak, who was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab.  Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Balak has brought me from Aram,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the king of Moab from the eastern mountains:</span><br>‘Come, curse Jacob for me;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Come, denounce Israel!’</span><br>How can I curse whom God has not cursed?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>How can I denounce those whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has not denounced?</span><br>For from the top of the crags I see him,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>from the hills I behold him.</span><br>Here is a people living alone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and not reckoning itself among the nations!</span><br>Who can count the dust of Jacob,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or number the dust-cloud of Israel?</span><br>Let me die the death of the upright,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and let my end be like his!”</span></p></div> <p>Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but now you have done nothing but bless them.”  He answered, “Must I not take care to say what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> puts into my mouth?”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants</h3>
<p>“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country.  When the harvest time had come, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his produce.  But the tenants seized his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.  Again he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they treated them in the same way.  Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’  But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.’  So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.  Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”  They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest time.”</p> <p>Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The stone that the builders rejected<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>has become the cornerstone;</span><br>this was the Lord’s doing,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and it is amazing in our eyes’?</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom.  The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”</p> <p>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them.  They wanted to arrest him, but they feared the crowds, because they regarded him as a prophet.</p>
