<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Spies Sent to Jericho</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Joshua son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and spent the night there.  The king of Jericho was told, “Some Israelites have come here tonight to search out the land.”  Then the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come only to search out the whole land.”  But the woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.  And when it was time to close the gate at dark, the men went out. Where the men went I do not know. Pursue them quickly, for you can overtake them.”  She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax that she had laid out on the roof.  So the men pursued them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. As soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</p> <p>Before they went to sleep, she came up to them on the roof  and said to the men: “I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt in fear before you.  For we have heard how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.  As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any of us because of you. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth below.  Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, swear to me by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that you in turn will deal kindly with my family. Give me a sign of good faith  that you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”  The men said to her, “Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives us the land.”</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Ten Bridesmaids</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.  Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.  When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them;  but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.  As the bridegroom was delayed, all of them became drowsy and slept.  But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’  Then all those bridesmaids got up and trimmed their lamps.  The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’  But the wise replied, ‘No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’  And while they went to buy it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut.  Later the other bridesmaids came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’  But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’  Keep awake therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.</p>
