<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>When the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were in front of the people.  Now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest. So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water,  the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho.  While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan.</p> <h3>Twelve Stones Set Up at Gilgal</h3>

 <h3>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,  “You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</p> <p>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,  and they conspired to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.  But they said, “Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.”</p> <h3>The Anointing at Bethany</h3>
<p>Now while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,  a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.  But when the disciples saw it, they were angry and said, “Why this waste?  For this ointment could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to the poor.”  But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? She has performed a good service for me.  For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.  By pouring this ointment on my body she has prepared me for burial.  Truly I tell you, wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.”</p> <h3>Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</h3>
<p>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests  and said, “What will you give me if I betray him to you?” They paid him thirty pieces of silver.  And from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.</p>
