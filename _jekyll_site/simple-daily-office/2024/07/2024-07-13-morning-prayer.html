<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Moses Dies and Is Buried in the Land of Moab</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> showed him the whole land: Gilead as far as Dan,  all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,  the Negeb, and the Plain—that is, the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees—as far as Zoar.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants’; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”  Then Moses, the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, died there in the land of Moab, at the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s command.  He was buried in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor, but no one knows his burial place to this day.  Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died; his sight was unimpaired and his vigor had not abated.  The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the period of mourning for Moses was ended.</p> <p>Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands on him; and the Israelites obeyed him, doing as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.</p> <p>Never since has there arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> knew face to face.  He was unequaled for all the signs and wonders that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent him to perform in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants and his entire land,  and for all the mighty deeds and all the terrifying displays of power that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.</p>

 <h3>The Lesson of the Fig Tree</h3>
<p>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates.  Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.  Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p> <h3>The Necessity for Watchfulness</h3>
<p>“But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.  For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.  For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,  and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man.  Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.  Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.  Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.  But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.  Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.</p> <h3>The Faithful or the Unfaithful Slave</h3>
<p>“Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom his master has put in charge of his household, to give the other slaves their allowance of food at the proper time?  Blessed is that slave whom his master will find at work when he arrives.  Truly I tell you, he will put that one in charge of all his possessions.  But if that wicked slave says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’  and he begins to beat his fellow slaves, and eats and drinks with drunkards,  the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not know.  He will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
