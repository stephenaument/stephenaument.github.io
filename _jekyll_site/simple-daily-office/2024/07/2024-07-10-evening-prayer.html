<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Anointed as King</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”  Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’  Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.”  Samuel did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”  He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</p> <p>When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed is now before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> looks on the heart.”  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has not chosen any of these.”  Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”  He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.”  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.</p>

 <h3>God’s Election of Israel</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">I am speaking the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience confirms it by the Holy Spirit—  I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.  For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my own people, my kindred according to the flesh.  They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises;  to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.</p> <p>It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,  and not all of Abraham’s children are his true descendants; but “It is through Isaac that descendants shall be named for you.”  This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.  For this is what the promise said, “About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.”  Nor is that all; something similar happened to Rebecca when she had conceived children by one husband, our ancestor Isaac.  Even before they had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose of election might continue,  not by works but by his call) she was told, “The elder shall serve the younger.”  As it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I have loved Jacob,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but I have hated Esau.”</span></p></div> <p>What then are we to say? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means!  For he says to Moses,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">So it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.  For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “I have raised you up for the very purpose of showing my power in you, so that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.”  So then he has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses.</p>
