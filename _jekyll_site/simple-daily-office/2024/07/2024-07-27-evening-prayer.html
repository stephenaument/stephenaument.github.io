<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Mourns for Saul and Jonathan</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.  On the third day, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.  David said to him, “Where have you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”  David said to him, “How did things go? Tell me!” He answered, “The army fled from the battle, but also many of the army fell and died; and Saul and his son Jonathan also died.”  Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?”  The young man reporting to him said, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa; and there was Saul leaning on his spear, while the chariots and the horsemen drew close to him.  When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here sir.’  And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’  He said to me, ‘Come, stand over me and kill me; for convulsions have seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’  So I stood over him, and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”</p> <p>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them; and all the men who were with him did the same.  They mourned and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for his son Jonathan, and for the army of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.  David said to the young man who had reported to him, “Where do you come from?” He answered, “I am the son of a resident alien, an Amalekite.”  David said to him, “Were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed?”  Then David called one of the young men and said, “Come here and strike him down.” So he struck him down and he died.  David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed.’”</p>

<p> At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem in a ministry to the saints;  for Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to share their resources with the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.  They were pleased to do this, and indeed they owe it to them; for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material things.  So, when I have completed this, and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will set out by way of you to Spain;  and I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</p> <p>I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf,  that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,  so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.  The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our<br>necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have<br>compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those<br>things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our<br>blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son<br>Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.

in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
