<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.  Now therefore, I pray, pardon my sin, and return with me, so that I may worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has rejected you from being king over Israel.”  As Samuel turned to go away, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.  And Samuel said to him, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this very day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.  Moreover the Glory of Israel will not recant or change his mind; for he is not a mortal, that he should change his mind.”  Then Saul said, “I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.”  So Samuel turned back after Saul; and Saul worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me.” And Agag came to him haltingly. Agag said, “Surely this is the bitterness of death.”  But Samuel said,</p>

Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was sorry that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>

 <h3>God’s Love in Christ Jesus</h3>
<p>What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?  He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else?  Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.  Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.  Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  As it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For your sake we are being killed all day long;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,  nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
