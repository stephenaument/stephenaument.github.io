<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Abner Is Killed by Joab</h3>
<p>Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for David had dismissed him, and he had gone away in peace.  When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, “Abner son of Ner came to the king, and he has dismissed him, and he has gone away in peace.”  Then Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came to you; why did you dismiss him, so that he got away?  You know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you, and to learn your comings and goings and to learn all that you are doing.”</p> <p>When Joab came out from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it.  When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gateway to speak with him privately, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. So he died for shedding the blood of Asahel, Joab’s brother.  Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for the blood of Abner son of Ner.  May the guilt fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks food!”  So Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.</p> <p>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourn over Abner.” And King David followed the bier.  They buried Abner at Hebron. The king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.  The king lamented for Abner, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Should Abner die as a fool dies?<br>Your hands were not bound,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>your feet were not fettered;</span><br>as one falls before the wicked<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you have fallen.”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">And all the people wept over him again.  Then all the people came to persuade David to eat something while it was still day; but David swore, saying, “So may God do to me, and more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!”  All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; just as everything the king did pleased all the people.  So all the people and all Israel understood that day that the king had no part in the killing of Abner son of Ner.  And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?  Today I am powerless, even though anointed king; these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too violent for me. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> pay back the one who does wickedly in accordance with his wickedness!”</p>

 <h3>The Promise of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning  until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.  After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.  While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. “This,” he said, “is what you have heard from me;  for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</p> <h3>The Ascension of Jesus</h3>
<p>So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”  He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.  But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”  When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.  While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them.  They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”</p> <h3>Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</h3>
<p>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey away.  When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.  All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.</p>
