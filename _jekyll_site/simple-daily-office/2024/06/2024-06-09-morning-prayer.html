<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Frustration of Desires</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon humankind:  those to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing of all that they desire, yet God does not enable them to enjoy these things, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous ill.  A man may beget a hundred children, and live many years; but however many are the days of his years, if he does not enjoy life’s good things, or has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.  For it comes into vanity and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered;  moreover it has not seen the sun or known anything; yet it finds rest rather than he.  Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy no good—do not all go to one place?</p> <p>All human toil is for the mouth, yet the appetite is not satisfied.  For what advantage have the wise over fools? And what do the poor have who know how to conduct themselves before the living?  Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire; this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</p> <p>Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what human beings are, and that they are not able to dispute with those who are stronger.  The more words, the more vanity, so how is one the better?  For who knows what is good for mortals while they live the few days of their vain life, which they pass like a shadow? For who can tell them what will be after them under the sun?</p>

 <p>“Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.  Sell your possessions, and give alms.

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p> <h3>Watchful Slaves</h3>
<p>“Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit;  be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks.  Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them.  If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.</p> <p>“But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.  You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”</p>
