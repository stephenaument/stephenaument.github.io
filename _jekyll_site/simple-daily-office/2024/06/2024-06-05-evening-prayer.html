<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p class="chapter-2"> If prophets or those who divine by dreams appear among you and promise you omens or portents,  and the omens or the portents declared by them take place, and they say, “Let us follow other gods” (whom you have not known) “and let us serve them,”  you must not heed the words of those prophets or those who divine by dreams; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is testing you, to know whether you indeed love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God with all your heart and soul.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God you shall follow, him alone you shall fear, his commandments you shall keep, his voice you shall obey, him you shall serve, and to him you shall hold fast.  But those prophets or those who divine by dreams shall be put to death for having spoken treason against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God—who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery—to turn you from the way in which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God commanded you to walk.

Show them no pity or compassion and do not shield them.  But you shall surely kill them; your own hand shall be first against them to execute them, and afterwards the hand of all the people.  Stone them to death for trying to turn you away from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

 <h3>Paul Rebukes Peter at Antioch</h3>
<p>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood self-condemned;  for until certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But after they came, he drew back and kept himself separate for fear of the circumcision faction.  And the other Jews joined him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.  But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”</p> <h3>Jews and Gentiles Are Saved by Faith</h3>
<p>We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners;  yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law.  But if, in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!  But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I am a transgressor.  For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ;  and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.  I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</p>
