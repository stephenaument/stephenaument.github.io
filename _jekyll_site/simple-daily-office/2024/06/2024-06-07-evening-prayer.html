<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>First Fruits and Tithes</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When you have come into the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it,  you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his name.  You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time, and say to him, “Today I declare to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God that I have come into the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> swore to our ancestors to give us.”  When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it down before the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God,  you shall make this response before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God: “A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous.  When the Egyptians treated us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us,  we cried to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with signs and wonders;  and he brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.  So now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, have given me.” You shall set it down before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and bow down before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  Then you, together with the Levites and the aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given to you and to your house.</p>

 <h3>The Promise to Abraham</h3>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I give an example from daily life: once a person’s will has been ratified, no one adds to it or annuls it.  Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring; it does not say, “And to offsprings,” as of many; but it says, “And to your offspring,” that is, to one person, who is Christ.  My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.  For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.</p> <h3>The Purpose of the Law</h3>
<p>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring would come to whom the promise had been made; and it was ordained through angels by a mediator.  Now a mediator involves more than one party; but God is one.</p> <p>Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could make alive, then righteousness would indeed come through the law.  But the scripture has imprisoned all things under the power of sin, so that what was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</p>
