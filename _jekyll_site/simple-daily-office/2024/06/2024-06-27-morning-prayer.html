<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Budding of Aaron’s Rod</h3>
<p class="chapter-2"> The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the Israelites, and get twelve staffs from them, one for each ancestral house, from all the leaders of their ancestral houses. Write each man’s name on his staff,  and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each ancestral house.  Place them in the tent of meeting before the covenant, where I meet with you.  And the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout; thus I will put a stop to the complaints of the Israelites that they continually make against you.  Moses spoke to the Israelites; and all their leaders gave him staffs, one for each leader, according to their ancestral houses, twelve staffs; and the staff of Aaron was among theirs.  So Moses placed the staffs before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the tent of the covenant.</p> <p>When Moses went into the tent of the covenant on the next day, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted. It put forth buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.  Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to all the Israelites; and they looked, and each man took his staff.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Put back the staff of Aaron before the covenant, to be kept as a warning to rebels, so that you may make an end of their complaints against me, or else they will die.”  Moses did so; just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him, so he did.</p>

 <h3>A Third Time Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>While Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and said to them on the way,  “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death;  then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified; and on the third day he will be raised.”</p> <h3>The Request of the Mother of James and John</h3>
<p>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, and kneeling before him, she asked a favor of him.  And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Declare that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”  But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.”  He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</p> <p>When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers.  But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them.  It will not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant,  and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave;  just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”</p>

Amen.
