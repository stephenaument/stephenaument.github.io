<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 5</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <h3>Psalm 69</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Save me, O God, *</p><p class="indent">for the waters have risen up to my neck.</p><p class="space">I am sinking in deep mire, *</p><p class="indent">and there is no firm ground for my feet.</p><p class="space">I have come into deep waters, *</p><p class="indent">and the torrent washes over me.</p><p class="space">I have grown weary with my crying;</p><p>my throat is inflamed; *</p><p class="indent">my eyes have failed from looking for my God.</p><p class="space">Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;</p><p>my lying foes who would destroy me are mighty. *</p><p class="indent">Must I then give back what I never stole?</p><p class="space">O God, you know my foolishness, *</p><p class="indent">and my faults are not hidden from you.</p><p class="space">Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, Lord GOD of hosts; *</p><p class="indent">let not those who seek you be disgraced because of me, O God of Israel.</p><p>Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, *</p><p class="indent">and shame has covered my face.</p><p class="space">I have become a stranger to my own kindred, *</p><p class="indent">an alien to my mother's children.</p><p class="space">Zeal for your house has eaten me up; *</p><p class="indent">the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.</p><p class="space">I humbled myself with fasting, *</p><p class="indent">but that was turned to my reproach.</p><p class="space">I put on sack-cloth also, *</p><p class="indent">and became a byword among them.</p><p class="space">Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, *</p><p class="indent">and the drunkards make songs about me.</p><p class="space">But as for me, this is my prayer to you, *</p><p class="indent">at the time you have set, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>:</p><p class="space">"In your great mercy, O God, *</p><p class="indent">answer me with your unfailing help.</p><p class="space">Save me from the mire;

*</p><p class="indent">your help, O God, will lift me up on high.</p><p class="space">I will praise the Name of God in song; *</p><p class="indent">I will proclaim his greatness with thanksgiving.</p><p class="space">This will please the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> more than an offering of oxen, *</p><p class="indent">more than bullocks with horns and hoofs.</p><p>The afflicted shall see and be glad; *</p><p class="indent">you who seek God, your heart shall live.</p><p class="space">For the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> listens to the needy, *</p><p class="indent">and his prisoners he does not despise.</p><p class="space">Let the heavens and the earth praise him, *</p><p class="indent">the seas and all that moves in them;</p><p class="space">For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah;

 <p>Rejoice, young man, while you are young, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Follow the inclination of your heart and the desire of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</p> <p>Banish anxiety from your mind, and put away pain from your body; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.</p> <p class="chapter-2">Remember your creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come, and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;  before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return with the rain;  in the day when the guards of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the women who grind cease working because they are few, and those who look through the windows see dimly;  when the doors on the street are shut, and the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;  when one is afraid of heights, and terrors are in the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along and desire fails; because all must go to their eternal home, and the mourners will go about the streets;  before the silver cord is snapped, and the golden bowl is broken, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel broken at the cistern,  and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the breath returns to God who gave it.  Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher; all is vanity.</p> <h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>Besides being wise, the Teacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs.  The Teacher sought to find pleasing words, and he wrote words of truth plainly.</p> <p>The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings that are given by one shepherd.  Of anything beyond these, my child, beware. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p> <p>The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone.  For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.  And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you.”  But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”</p> <h3>The Cross and Self-Denial</h3>
<p>Then Jesus told his disciples, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.  For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.  For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?</p> <p>“For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everyone for what has been done.  Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</p>
