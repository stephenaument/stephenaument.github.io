<h3 class="title">Saturday In The Week Of Proper 4</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Ecclesiastes 5:8-20</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and right, do not be amazed at the matter; for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.  But all things considered, this is an advantage for a land: a king for a plowed field.</p> <p>The lover of money will not be satisfied with money; nor the lover of wealth, with gain. This also is vanity.</p> <p>When goods increase, those who eat them increase; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes?</p> <p>Sweet is the sleep of laborers, whether they eat little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let them sleep.</p> <p>There is a grievous ill that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owners to their hurt,  and those riches were lost in a bad venture; though they are parents of children, they have nothing in their hands.  As they came from their mother’s womb, so they shall go again, naked as they came; they shall take nothing for their toil, which they may carry away with their hands.  This also is a grievous ill: just as they came, so shall they go; and what gain do they have from toiling for the wind?  Besides, all their days they eat in darkness, in much vexation and sickness and resentment.</p> <p>This is what I have seen to be good: it is fitting to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of the life God gives us; for this is our lot.  Likewise all to whom God gives wealth and possessions and whom he enables to enjoy them, and to accept their lot and find enjoyment in their toil—this is the gift of God.  For they will scarcely brood over the days of their lives, because God keeps them occupied with the joy of their hearts.</p>

 <h3>The Tradition of the Elders</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,  “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands before they eat.”  He answered them, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?  For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.’  But you say that whoever tells father or mother, ‘Whatever support you might have had from me is given to God,’ then that person need not honor the father.  So, for the sake of your tradition, you make void the word of God.  You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘This people honors me with their lips,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but their hearts are far from me;</span><br>in vain do they worship me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>teaching human precepts as doctrines.’”</span></p></div> <h3>Things That Defile</h3>
<p>Then he called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand:  it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.”  Then the disciples approached and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?”  He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.  Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit.”  But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”  Then he said, “Are you also still without understanding?  Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?  But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles.  For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.  These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.”</p>
