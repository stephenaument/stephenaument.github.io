<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels; they had no regard for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>  or for the duties of the priests to the people. When anyone offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,  and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.  Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the one who was sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”  And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take whatever you wish,” he would say, “No, you must give it now; if not, I will take it by force.”  Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for they treated the offerings of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with contempt.</p> <h3>The Child Samuel at Shiloh</h3>
<p>Samuel was ministering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, a boy wearing a linen ephod.  His mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> repay you with children by this woman for the gift that she made to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>”; and then they would return to their home.</p> <p>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> took note of Hannah; she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Prophecy against Eli’s Household</h3>
<p>Now Eli was very old. He heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.  He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.  No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spreading abroad.  If one person sins against another, someone can intercede for the sinner with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but if someone sins against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who can make intercession?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to kill them.</p> <p>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and with the people.</p>

 <p>And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done.  They were filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, craftiness, they are gossips,  slanderers, God-haters, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, rebellious toward parents,  foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  They know God’s decree, that those who practice such things deserve to die—yet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them.</p> <h3>The Righteous Judgment of God</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things.  You say, “We know that God’s judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth.”  Do you imagine, whoever you are, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?  Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not realize that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?  But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.  For he will repay according to each one’s deeds:  to those who by patiently doing good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;  while for those who are self-seeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.  There will be anguish and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,  but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.  For God shows no partiality.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
