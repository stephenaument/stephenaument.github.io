<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samuel’s Calling and Prophetic Activity</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> under Eli. The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.</p> <p>At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his room;  the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, where the ark of God was.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> called, “Samuel! Samuel!” and he said, “Here I am!”  and ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> called again, “Samuel!” Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”  Now Samuel did not yet know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had not yet been revealed to him.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> called Samuel again, a third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was calling the boy.  Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p> <p>Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears of it tingle.  On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.  For I have told him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.  Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering forever.”</p> <p>Samuel lay there until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.  But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” He said, “Here I am.”  Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.”  So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. Then he said, “It is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; let him do what seems good to him.”</p> <p>As Samuel grew up, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.  And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a trustworthy prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> continued to appear at Shiloh, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  </p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.  So, if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?  Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law.  For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.  Rather, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart—it is spiritual and not literal. Such a person receives praise not from others but from God.</p> <p class="chapter-1">Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?  Much, in every way. For in the first place the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.  What if some were unfaithful? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?  By no means! Although everyone is a liar, let God be proved true, as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“So that you may be justified in your words,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and prevail in your judging.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of God, what should we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)  By no means! For then how could God judge the world?  But if through my falsehood God’s truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?  And why not say (as some people slander us by saying that we say), “Let us do evil so that good may come”? Their condemnation is deserved!</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
