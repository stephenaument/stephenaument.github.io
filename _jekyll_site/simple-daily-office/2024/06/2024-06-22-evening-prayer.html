<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.</p>
<h3>The Ark of God Captured</h3>
<p>In those days the Philistines mustered for war against Israel, and Israel went out to battle against them; they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.  The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle was joined, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.  When the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> here from Shiloh, so that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.”  So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p> <p>When the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.  When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” When they learned that the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had come to the camp,  the Philistines were afraid; for they said, “Gods have come into the camp.” They also said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.  Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.  Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, in order not to become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.”</p> <p>So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated, and they fled, everyone to his home. There was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.  The ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</p>

 <h3>None Is Righteous</h3>
<p>What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all; for we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin,  as it is written:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“There is no one who is righteous, not even one;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there is no one who has understanding,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>there is no one who seeks God.</span><br>All have turned aside, together they have become worthless;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there is no one who shows kindness,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>there is not even one.”</span><br>“Their throats are opened graves;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they use their tongues to deceive.”</span><br>“The venom of vipers is under their lips.”<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”</span><br>“Their feet are swift to shed blood;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>ruin and misery are in their paths,</span><br>and the way of peace they have not known.”<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</span></p></div> <p>Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.  For “no human being will be justified in his sight” by deeds prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
