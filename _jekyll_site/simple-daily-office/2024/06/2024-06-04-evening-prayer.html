<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Pagan Shrines to Be Destroyed</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">These are the statutes and ordinances that you must diligently observe in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, has given you to occupy all the days that you live on the earth.</p> <p>You must demolish completely all the places where the nations whom you are about to dispossess served their gods, on the mountain heights, on the hills, and under every leafy tree.  Break down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their sacred poles with fire, and hew down the idols of their gods, and thus blot out their name from their places.  You shall not worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God in such ways.  But you shall seek the place that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will choose out of all your tribes as his habitation to put his name there. You shall go there,  bringing there your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, your votive gifts, your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and flocks.  And you shall eat there in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, you and your households together, rejoicing in all the undertakings in which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has blessed you.</p> <p>You shall not act as we are acting here today, all of us according to our own desires,  for you have not yet come into the rest and the possession that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you.  When you cross over the Jordan and live in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is allotting to you, and when he gives you rest from your enemies all around so that you live in safety,  then you shall bring everything that I command you to the place that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his name: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and your donations, and all your choice votive gifts that you vow to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And you shall rejoice before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, you together with your sons and your daughters, your male and female slaves, and the Levites who reside in your towns (since they have no allotment or inheritance with you).</p>

 <p>Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord’s brother.  In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!  Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,  and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;  they only heard it said, “The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.”  And they glorified God because of me.</p> <h3>Paul and the Other Apostles</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.  I went up in response to a revelation. Then I laid before them (though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure that I was not running, or had not run, in vain.  But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.  But because of false believers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us—  we did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you.  And from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders (what they actually were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those leaders contributed nothing to me.  On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised  (for he who worked through Peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the Gentiles),  and when James and Cephas and John, who were acknowledged pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.  They asked only one thing, that we remember the poor, which was actually what I was eager to do.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
