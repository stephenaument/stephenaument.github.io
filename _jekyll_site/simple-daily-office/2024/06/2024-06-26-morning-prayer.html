<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p> Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to take the censers out of the blaze; then scatter the fire far and wide.  For the censers of these sinners have become holy at the cost of their lives. Make them into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they presented them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the Israelites.  So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been presented by those who were burned; and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar—  a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, shall approach to offer incense before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, so as not to become like Korah and his company—just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to him through Moses.</p> <p>On the next day, however, the whole congregation of the Israelites rebelled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  And when the congregation had assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting; the cloud had covered it and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared.  Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,  and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying,  “Get away from this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their faces.  Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire on it from the altar and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the plague has begun.”  So Aaron took it as Moses had ordered, and ran into the middle of the assembly, where the plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.  He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.  Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.  When the plague was stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</p>

 <h3>The Laborers in the Vineyard</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.  After agreeing with the laborers for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard.  When he went out about nine o’clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace;  and he said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ So they went.  When he went out again about noon and about three o’clock, he did the same.  And about five o’clock he went out and found others standing around; and he said to them, ‘Why are you standing here idle all day?’  They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’  When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and then going to the first.’  When those hired about five o’clock came, each of them received the usual daily wage.  Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received the usual daily wage.  And when they received it, they grumbled against the landowner,  saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’  But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?  Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last the same as I give to you.  Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’  So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”</p>
