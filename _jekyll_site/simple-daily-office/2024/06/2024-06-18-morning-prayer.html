<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Complaining in the Desert</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now when the people complained in the hearing of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> about their misfortunes, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> heard it and his anger was kindled. Then the fire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> burned against them, and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.  But the people cried out to Moses; and Moses prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the fire abated.  So that place was called Taberah, because the fire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> burned against them.</p> <p>The rabble among them had a strong craving; and the Israelites also wept again, and said, “If only we had meat to eat!  We remember the fish we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;  but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”</p> <p>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its color was like the color of gum resin.  The people went around and gathered it, ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, then boiled it in pots and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.  When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna would fall with it.</p> <p>Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, all at the entrances of their tents. Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> became very angry, and Moses was displeased.  So Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?  Did I conceive all this people? Did I give birth to them, that you should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a sucking child, to the land that you promised on oath to their ancestors’?  Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they come weeping to me and say, ‘Give us meat to eat!’  I am not able to carry all this people alone, for they are too heavy for me.  If this is the way you are going to treat me, put me to death at once—if I have found favor in your sight—and do not let me see my misery.”</p> <h3>The Seventy Elders</h3>
<p>So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tent of meeting, and have them take their place there with you.  I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some of the spirit that is on you and put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people along with you so that you will not bear it all by yourself.  And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wailed in the hearing of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying, ‘If only we had meat to eat! Surely it was better for us in Egypt.’ Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give you meat, and you shall eat.  You shall eat not only one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,  but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you—because you have rejected the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”  But Moses said, “The people I am with number six hundred thousand on foot; and you say, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat for a whole month’!  Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them? Are there enough fish in the sea to catch for them?”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s power limited? Now you shall see whether my word will come true for you or not.”</p>

 <h3>Jesus Again Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands,  and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they were greatly distressed.</p> <h3>Jesus and the Temple Tax</h3>
<p>When they reached Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?”  He said, “Yes, he does.” And when he came home, Jesus spoke of it first, asking, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their children or from others?”  When Peter said, “From others,” Jesus said to him, “Then the children are free.  However, so that we do not give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook; take the first fish that comes up; and when you open its mouth, you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for you and me.”</p>
