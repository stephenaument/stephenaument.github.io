<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Samuel as Judge</h3>
<p>Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you. Direct your heart to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”  So Israel put away the Baals and the Astartes, and they served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> only.</p> <p>Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for you.”  So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. They fasted that day, and said, “We have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.</p> <p>When the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines.  The people of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God for us, and pray that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”  So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; Samuel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for Israel, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> answered him.  As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel; but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> thundered with a mighty voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion; and they were routed before Israel.  And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as beyond Beth-car.</p> <p>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, and named it Ebenezer; for he said, “Thus far the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has helped us.”  So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel; the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.  The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.</p> <p>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  He went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these places.  Then he would come back to Ramah, for his home was there; he administered justice there to Israel, and built there an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>God’s Promise Realized through Faith</h3>
<p>For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of faith.  If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.  For the law brings wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there violation.</p> <p>For this reason it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of us,  as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”)—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.  Hoping against hope, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” according to what was said, “So numerous shall your descendants be.”  He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was already as good as dead (for he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb.  No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,  being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.  Therefore his faith “was reckoned to him as righteousness.”  Now the words, “it was reckoned to him,” were written not for his sake alone,  but for ours also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,  who was handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification.</p>
