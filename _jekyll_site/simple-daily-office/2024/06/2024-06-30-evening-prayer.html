<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him; he said, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has anointed you ruler over his people Israel. You shall reign over the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and you will save them from the hand of their enemies all around. Now this shall be the sign to you that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has anointed you ruler over his heritage:  When you depart from me today you will meet two men by Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; they will say to you, ‘The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now your father has stopped worrying about them and is worrying about you, saying: What shall I do about my son?’  Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor; three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.  They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from them.  After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim, at the place where the Philistine garrison is; there, as you come to the town, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the shrine with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre playing in front of them; they will be in a prophetic frenzy.  Then the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will possess you, and you will be in a prophetic frenzy along with them and be turned into a different person.  Now when these signs meet you, do whatever you see fit to do, for God is with you.  And you shall go down to Gilgal ahead of me; then I will come down to you to present burnt offerings and offer sacrifices of well-being. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.”</p> <h3>Saul Prophesies</h3>
<p>As he turned away to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs were fulfilled that day.  When they were going from there to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God possessed him, and he fell into a prophetic frenzy along with them.  When all who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”  A man of the place answered, “And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”  When his prophetic frenzy had ended, he went home.</p> <p>Saul’s uncle said to him and to the boy, “Where did you go?” And he replied, “To seek the donkeys; and when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”  Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me what Samuel said to you.”  Saul said to his uncle, “He told us that the donkeys had been found.” But about the matter of the kingship, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.</p>

<p> Many of them therefore believed, including not a few Greek women and men of high standing.  But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Beroea as well, they came there too, to stir up and incite the crowds.  Then the believers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.  Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left him.</p> <h3>Paul in Athens</h3>
<p>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply distressed to see that the city was full of idols.  So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and also in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.  Also some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers debated with him. Some said, “What does this babbler want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign divinities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.)  So they took him and brought him to the Areopagus and asked him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?  It sounds rather strange to us, so we would like to know what it means.”  Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there would spend their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new.</p> <p>Then Paul stood in front of the Areopagus and said, “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way.  For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.  The God who made the world and everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by human hands,  nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things.  From one ancestor he made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live,  so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from each one of us.  For ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; as even some of your own poets have said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘For we too are his offspring.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of mortals.  While God has overlooked the times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent,  because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.”</p> <p>When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; but others said, “We will hear you again about this.”  At that point Paul left them.  But some of them joined him and became believers, including Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>
