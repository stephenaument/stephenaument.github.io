<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p class="chapter-2">You shall love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, therefore, and keep his charge, his decrees, his ordinances, and his commandments always.  Remember today that it was not your children (who have not known or seen the discipline of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God), but it is you who must acknowledge his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,  his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land;  what he did to the Egyptian army, to their horses and chariots, how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, so that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has destroyed them to this day;  what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;  and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab son of Reuben, how in the midst of all Israel the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households, their tents, and every living being in their company;  for it is your own eyes that have seen every great deed that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did.</p> <p>Keep, then, this entire commandment that I am commanding you today, so that you may have strength to go in and occupy the land that you are crossing over to occupy,  and so that you may live long in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> swore to your ancestors to give them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.  For the land that you are about to enter to occupy is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sow your seed and irrigate by foot like a vegetable garden.  But the land that you are crossing over to occupy is a land of hills and valleys, watered by rain from the sky,  a land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God looks after. The eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.</p>

 <h3>Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch</h3>
<p>Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a wilderness road.)  So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship  and was returning home; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.  Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to this chariot and join it.”  So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”  He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.  Now the passage of the scripture that he was reading was this:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and like a lamb silent before its shearer,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>so he does not open his mouth.</span><br>In his humiliation justice was denied him.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Who can describe his generation?</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>For his life is taken away from the earth.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">The eunuch asked Philip, “About whom, may I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”  Then Philip began to speak, and starting with this scripture, he proclaimed to him the good news about Jesus.  As they were going along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is to prevent me from being baptized?”  He commanded the chariot to stop, and both of them, Philip and the eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.  When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.  But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</p>
