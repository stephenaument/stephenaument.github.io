<h3 class="title">Saturday In The Week Of Proper 6</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> Then the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against this people, for they are stronger than we.”  So they brought to the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out, saying, “The land that we have gone through as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are of great size.  There we saw the Nephilim (the Anakites come from the Nephilim); and to ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”</p> <h3>The People Rebel</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.  And all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron; the whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!  Why is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become booty; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?”  So they said to one another, “Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt.”</p> <p>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the Israelites.  And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes  and said to all the congregation of the Israelites, “The land that we went through as spies is an exceedingly good land.  If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is pleased with us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.  Only, do not rebel against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and do not fear the people of the land, for they are no more than bread for us; their protection is removed from them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is with us; do not fear them.”  But the whole congregation threatened to stone them.</p>
<p>Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? And how long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?  I will strike them with pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”</p> <h3>Moses Intercedes for the People</h3>
<p>But Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for in your might you brought up this people from among them,  and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are in the midst of this people; for you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go in front of them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.  Now if you kill this people all at one time, then the nations who have heard about you will say,  ‘It is because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them that he has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’  And now, therefore, let the power of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> be great in the way that you promised when you spoke, saying,</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is slow to anger,<br>and abounding in steadfast love,<br>forgiving iniquity and transgression,<br>but by no means clearing the guilty,<br>visiting the iniquity of the parents<br>upon the children<br>to the third and the fourth generation.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Forgive the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have pardoned this people, from Egypt even until now.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “I do forgive, just as you have asked;  nevertheless—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>—  none of the people who have seen my glory and the signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have tested me these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,  shall see the land that I swore to give to their ancestors; none of those who despised me shall see it.  But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me wholeheartedly, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.  Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Teaching about Divorce</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.  Large crowds followed him, and he cured them there.</p> <p>Some Pharisees came to him, and to test him they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?”  He answered, “Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning ‘made them male and female,’  and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’?  So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”  They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?”  He said to them, “It was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.  And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another commits adultery.”</p> <p>His disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”  But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given.  For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.”</p>
