<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>So Moses went out and told the people the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he gathered seventy elders of the people, and placed them all around the tent.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do so again.</p> <p>Two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.  And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”  And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, “My lord Moses, stop them!”  But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s people were prophets, and that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> would put his spirit on them!”  And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</p> <h3>The Quails</h3>
<p>Then a wind went out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and it brought quails from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, about two cubits deep on the ground.  So the people worked all that day and night and all the next day, gathering the quails; the least anyone gathered was ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.  But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against the people, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> struck the people with a very great plague.  So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.  From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth.</p>

 <h3>True Greatness</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”  He called a child, whom he put among them,  and said, “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.</p> <h3>Temptations to Sin</h3>
<p>“If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea.  Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! Occasions for stumbling are bound to come, but woe to the one by whom the stumbling block comes!</p> <p>“If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into the eternal fire.  And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the hell of fire.</p>
