<h3 class="title">Saturday In The Week Of Proper 5</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Sons of Aaron</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">This is the lineage of Aaron and Moses at the time when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.  These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar;  these are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to minister as priests.  Nadab and Abihu died before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> when they offered unholy fire before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron.</p> <h3>The Duties of the Levites</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, so that they may assist him.  They shall perform duties for him and for the whole congregation in front of the tent of meeting, doing service at the tabernacle;  they shall be in charge of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and attend to the duties for the Israelites as they do service at the tabernacle.  You shall give the Levites to Aaron and his descendants; they are unreservedly given to him from among the Israelites.  But you shall make a register of Aaron and his descendants; it is they who shall attend to the priesthood, and any outsider who comes near shall be put to death.</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  I hereby accept the Levites from among the Israelites as substitutes for all the firstborn that open the womb among the Israelites. The Levites shall be mine,  for all the firstborn are mine; when I killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both human and animal; they shall be mine. I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>The Transfiguration</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves.  And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.  Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.  Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!”  When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear.  But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up and do not be afraid.”  And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.</p> <p>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, “Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”  And the disciples asked him, “Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”  He replied, “Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things;  but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.”  Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.</p>
