<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Cloud and the Fire</h3>
<p>On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant; and from evening until morning it was over the tabernacle, having the appearance of fire.  It was always so: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.  Whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, then the Israelites would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the Israelites would camp.  At the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the Israelites would set out, and at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would camp. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they would remain in camp.  Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the Israelites would keep the charge of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and would not set out.  Sometimes the cloud would remain a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would remain in camp; then according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would set out.  Sometimes the cloud would remain from evening until morning; and when the cloud lifted in the morning, they would set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they would set out.  Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, resting upon it, the Israelites would remain in camp and would not set out; but when it lifted they would set out.  At the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would camp, and at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would set out.

 <h3>Jesus Cures a Boy with a Demon</h3>
<p>When they came to the crowd, a man came to him, knelt before him,  and said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; he often falls into the fire and often into the water.  And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.”  Jesus answered, “You faithless and perverse generation, how much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.”  And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured instantly.  Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”  He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.”</p>
