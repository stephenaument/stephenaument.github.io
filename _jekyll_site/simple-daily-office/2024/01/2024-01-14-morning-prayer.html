<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Great Flood</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation.  Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate;  and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive upon the face of all the earth.  For in seven days I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.”  And Noah did all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him.</p> <p>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.  And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him went into the ark, to escape the waters of the flood.  Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,  two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.  And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.</p>

 <p>The flood continued forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.  The waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.  And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;  the waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, birds, cattle, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth, and every man;  everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.  He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.  </p>

 <h3>A Multitude at the Seaside</h3>
<p>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea  and Jerusalem and Idume′a and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came to him.  And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him;  for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.  And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”  And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</p> <h3>Jesus Appoints the Twelve</h3>
<p>And he went up into the hills, and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him.  And he appointed twelve, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach  and have authority to cast out demons:  Simon whom he surnamed Peter;  James the son of Zeb′edee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Bo-aner′ges, that is, sons of thunder;  Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,  and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</p>
