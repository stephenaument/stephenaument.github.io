<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Mediator of a Better Covenant</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,  a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the Lord, and not any mortal, has set up.  For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.  Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.  They offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one; for Moses, when he was about to erect the tent, was warned, “See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”  But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted through better promises.  For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.</p> <p>God finds fault with them when he says:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The days are surely coming, says the Lord,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and with the house of Judah;</span><br>not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;</span><br>for they did not continue in my covenant,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and so I had no concern for them, says the Lord.</span><br>This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>after those days, says the Lord:</span><br>I will put my laws in their minds,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and write them on their hearts,</span><br>and I will be their God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and they shall be my people.</span><br>And they shall not teach one another<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or say to each other, ‘Know the Lord,’</span><br>for they shall all know me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>from the least of them to the greatest.</span><br>For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I will remember their sins no more.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">In speaking of “a new covenant,” he has made the first one obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.</p>
