<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels; they had no regard for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>  or for the duties of the priests to the people. When anyone offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,  and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.  Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the one who was sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”  And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take whatever you wish,” he would say, “No, you must give it now; if not, I will take it by force.”  Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for they treated the offerings of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with contempt.</p> <h3>The Child Samuel at Shiloh</h3>
<p>Samuel was ministering before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, a boy wearing a linen ephod.  His mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> repay you with children by this woman for the gift that she made to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>”; and then they would return to their home.</p> <p>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> took note of Hannah; she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Prophecy against Eli’s Household</h3>
<p>Now Eli was very old. He heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.  He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people.  No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spreading abroad.  If one person sins against another, someone can intercede for the sinner with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but if someone sins against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who can make intercession?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to kill them.</p> <p>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and with the people.</p>

 <h3>The Question about the Resurrection</h3>
<p>Some Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came to him  and asked him a question, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.  Now there were seven brothers; the first married, and died childless;  then the second  and the third married her, and so in the same way all seven died childless.  Finally the woman also died.  In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had married her.”</p> <p>Jesus said to them, “Those who belong to this age marry and are given in marriage;  but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.  Indeed they cannot die anymore, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.  And the fact that the dead are raised Moses himself showed, in the story about the bush, where he speaks of the Lord as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.  Now he is God not of the dead, but of the living; for to him all of them are alive.”  Then some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”  For they no longer dared to ask him another question.</p>
