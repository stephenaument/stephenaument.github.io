<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>So Moses went out and told the people the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he gathered seventy elders of the people, and placed them all around the tent.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do so again.</p> <p>Two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.  And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”  And Joshua son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, one of his chosen men, said, “My lord Moses, stop them!”  But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s people were prophets, and that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> would put his spirit on them!”  And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</p> <h3>The Quails</h3>
<p>Then a wind went out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and it brought quails from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, about two cubits deep on the ground.  So the people worked all that day and night and all the next day, gathering the quails; the least anyone gathered was ten homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.  But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against the people, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> struck the people with a very great plague.  So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had the craving.  From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth.</p>

 <h3>The Coming of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.  And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.  Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them.  All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.</p> <p>Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem.  And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each.  Amazed and astonished, they asked, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?  And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?  Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,  Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,  Cretans and Arabs—in our own languages we hear them speaking about God’s deeds of power.”  All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”  But others sneered and said, “They are filled with new wine.”</p> <h3>Peter Addresses the Crowd</h3>
<p>But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them, “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to what I say.  Indeed, these are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning.  No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘In the last days it will be, God declares,<br>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</span><br>and your young men shall see visions,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your old men shall dream dreams.</span><br>Even upon my slaves, both men and women,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in those days I will pour out my Spirit;</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and they shall prophesy.</span><br>And I will show portents in the heaven above<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and signs on the earth below,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>blood, and fire, and smoky mist.</span><br>The sun shall be turned to darkness<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the moon to blood,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>before the coming of the Lord’s great and glorious day.</span><br>Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</p></div>
