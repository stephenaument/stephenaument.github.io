<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “Thus the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said, ‘I revealed myself to the family of your ancestor in Egypt when they were slaves to the house of Pharaoh.  I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to offer incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I gave to the family of your ancestor all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.  Why then look with greedy eye at my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded, and honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?’  Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel declares: ‘I promised that your family and the family of your ancestor should go in and out before me forever’; but now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> declares: ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be treated with contempt.  See, a time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your ancestor’s family, so that no one in your family will live to old age.  Then in distress you will look with greedy eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed upon Israel; and no one in your family shall ever live to old age.  The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his eyes and grieve his heart; all the members of your household shall die by the sword.  The fate of your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you—both of them shall die on the same day.  I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed one forever.  Everyone who is left in your family shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me in one of the priest’s places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’”</p>

 <h3>The Question about David’s Son</h3>
<p>Then he said to them, “How can they say that the Messiah is David’s son?  For David himself says in the book of Psalms,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The Lord said to my Lord,<br>“Sit at my right hand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">David thus calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?”</p> <h3>Jesus Denounces the Scribes</h3>
<p>In the hearing of all the people he said to the disciples,  “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets.  They devour widows’ houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”</p> <h3>The Widow’s Offering</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">He looked up and saw rich people putting their gifts into the treasury;  he also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.  He said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them;  for all of them have contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
