<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Philistines and the Ark</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod;  then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.  When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.  But when they rose early on the next morning, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.  This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</p> <p>The hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was heavy upon the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and in its territory.  And when the inhabitants of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us; for his hand is heavy on us and on our god Dagon.”  So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” The inhabitants of Gath replied, “Let the ark of God be moved on to us.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath.  But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was against the city, causing a very great panic; he struck the inhabitants of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.  So they sent the ark of the God of Israel to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “Why have they brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people?”  They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.” For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there;  those who did not die were stricken with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p>

 <h3>The Lesson of the Fig Tree</h3>
<p>Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees;  as soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near.  So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.  Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place.  Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p> <h3>Exhortation to Watch</h3>
<p>“Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day does not catch you unexpectedly,  like a trap. For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.  Be alert at all times, praying that you may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</p>
