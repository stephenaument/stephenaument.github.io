<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Cloud and the Fire</h3>
<p>On the day the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant; and from evening until morning it was over the tabernacle, having the appearance of fire.  It was always so: the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night.  Whenever the cloud lifted from over the tent, then the Israelites would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the Israelites would camp.  At the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the Israelites would set out, and at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would camp. As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they would remain in camp.  Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the Israelites would keep the charge of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and would not set out.  Sometimes the cloud would remain a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would remain in camp; then according to the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would set out.  Sometimes the cloud would remain from evening until morning; and when the cloud lifted in the morning, they would set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they would set out.  Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, resting upon it, the Israelites would remain in camp and would not set out; but when it lifted they would set out.  At the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would camp, and at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> they would set out.

 <h3>The Promise of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning  until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.  After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.  While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. “This,” he said, “is what you have heard from me;  for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</p> <h3>The Ascension of Jesus</h3>
<p>So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”  He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.  But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”  When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.  While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them.  They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”</p> <h3>Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</h3>
<p>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day’s journey away.  When they had entered the city, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying, Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.  All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, as well as his brothers.</p>
