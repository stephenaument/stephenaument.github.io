<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Ecclesiastes 8:14-9:10</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people who are treated according to the conduct of the wicked, and there are wicked people who are treated according to the conduct of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.  So I commend enjoyment, for there is nothing better for people under the sun than to eat, and drink, and enjoy themselves, for this will go with them in their toil through the days of life that God gives them under the sun.</p> <p>When I applied my mind to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how one’s eyes see sleep neither day nor night,  then I saw all the work of God, that no one can find out what is happening under the sun. However much they may toil in seeking, they will not find it out; even though those who are wise claim to know, they cannot find it out.</p> <h3>Take Life as It Comes</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">All this I laid to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hate one does not know. Everything that confronts them  is vanity, since the same fate comes to all, to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to those who sacrifice and those who do not sacrifice. As are the good, so are the sinners; those who swear are like those who shun an oath.  This is an evil in all that happens under the sun, that the same fate comes to everyone. Moreover, the hearts of all are full of evil; madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.  But whoever is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.  The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no more reward, and even the memory of them is lost.  Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished; never again will they have any share in all that happens under the sun.</p> <p>Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has long ago approved what you do.  Let your garments always be white; do not let oil be lacking on your head.  Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that are given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.  Whatever your hand finds to do, do with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <h3>Paul and the False Apostles</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me!  I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.  But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by its cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.  For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.  I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.  I may be untrained in speech, but not in knowledge; certainly in every way and in all things we have made this evident to you.</p> <p>Did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed God’s good news to you free of charge?  I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.  And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for my needs were supplied by the friends who came from Macedonia. So I refrained and will continue to refrain from burdening you in any way.  As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.  And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p> <p>And what I do I will also continue to do, in order to deny an opportunity to those who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in what they boast about.  For such boasters are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.  And no wonder! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.  So it is not strange if his ministers also disguise themselves as ministers of righteousness. Their end will match their deeds.</p> <h3>Paul’s Sufferings as an Apostle</h3>
<p>I repeat, let no one think that I am a fool; but if you do, then accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.  What I am saying in regard to this boastful confidence, I am saying not with the Lord’s authority, but as a fool;  since many boast according to human standards, I will also boast.  For you gladly put up with fools, being wise yourselves!  For you put up with it when someone makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or gives you a slap in the face.  To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!</p>
<p>But whatever anyone dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that.  </p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
