<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <p>As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats:  Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture? When you drink of clear water, must you foul the rest with your feet?  And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet?</p> <p>Therefore, thus says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.  Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide,  I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.</p> <p>I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.  And I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, have spoken.</p> <p>I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild animals from the land, so that they may live in the wild and sleep in the woods securely.  I will make them and the region around my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing.  The trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase. They shall be secure on their soil; and they shall know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I break the bars of their yoke, and save them from the hands of those who enslaved them.  They shall no more be plunder for the nations, nor shall the animals of the land devour them; they shall live in safety, and no one shall make them afraid.  I will provide for them a splendid vegetation so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the insults of the nations.  They shall know that I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.  You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture and I am your God, says the Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Visits Martha and Mary</h3>
<p>Now as they went on their way, he entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.  She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he was saying.  But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.”  But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things;  there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.”</p>
