<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Fifth Vision: The Lampstand and Olive Trees</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as one is wakened from sleep.  He said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it; there are seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.  And by it there are two olive trees, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”  I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”  Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”  He said to me, “This is the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring out the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”</p> <p>Moreover the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to me, saying,  “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts has sent me to you.  For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.</p>
<p>“These seven are the eyes of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which range through the whole earth.”  Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”  And a second time I said to him, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which pour out the oil through the two golden pipes?”  He said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”  Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”</p>

<h3>11. The Third Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Surge, illuminare</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Arise, shine, for your light has come, *</p> <p class="indent">and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.</p> <p>For behold, darkness covers the land; *</p> <p class="indent">deep gloom enshrouds the peoples.</p> <p>But over you the Lord will rise, *</p> <p class="indent">and his glory will appear upon you.</p> <p>Nations will stream to your light, *</p> <p class="indent">and kings to the brightness of your dawning.</p> <p>Your gates will always be open; *</p> <p class="indent">by day or night they will never be shut.</p> <p>They will call you, The City of the Lord, *</p> <p class="indent">The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p> <p>Violence will no more be heard in your land, *</p> <p class="indent">ruin or destruction within your borders.</p> <p>You will call your walls, Salvation, *</p> <p class="indent">and all your portals, Praise.</p> <p>The sun will no more be your light by day; *</p> <p class="indent">by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.</p> <p>The Lord will be your everlasting light, *</p> <p class="indent">and your God will be your glory.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<div class="citation">Heb 7:18-28</div>
<h3>Heb 7:18-28</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="first-line-none">There is, on the one hand, the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual  (for the law made nothing perfect); there is, on the other hand, the introduction of a better hope, through which we approach God.</p> <p>This was confirmed with an oath; for others who became priests took their office without an oath,  but this one became a priest with an oath, because of the one who said to him,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The Lord has sworn<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and will not change his mind,</span><br>‘You are a priest forever’”—</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.</p> <p>Furthermore, the former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;  but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.  Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</p> <p>For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.  Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself.  For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
