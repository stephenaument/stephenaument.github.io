<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

 <h3>Balak Summons Balaam to Curse Israel</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The Israelites set out, and camped in the plains of Moab across the Jordan from Jericho.  Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.  Moab was in great dread of the people, because they were so numerous; Moab was overcome with fear of the people of Israel.  And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will now lick up all that is around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.  He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is on the Euphrates, in the land of Amaw, to summon him, saying, “A people has come out of Egypt; they have spread over the face of the earth, and they have settled next to me.  Come now, curse this people for me, since they are stronger than I; perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them from the land; for I know that whomever you bless is blessed, and whomever you curse is cursed.”</p> <p>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and gave him Balak’s message.  He said to them, “Stay here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> speaks to me”; so the officials of Moab stayed with Balaam.  God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”  Balaam said to God, “King Balak son of Zippor of Moab, has sent me this message:  ‘A people has come out of Egypt and has spread over the face of the earth; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them and drive them out.’”  God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”  So Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the officials of Balak, “Go to your own land, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has refused to let me go with you.”  So the officials of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”</p> <p>Once again Balak sent officials, more numerous and more distinguished than these.  They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor: ‘Do not let anything hinder you from coming to me;  for I will surely do you great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do; come, curse this people for me.’”  But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Although Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, to do less or more.  You remain here, as the others did, so that I may learn what more the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> may say to me.”  That night God came to Balaam and said to him, “If the men have come to summon you, get up and go with them; but do only what I tell you to do.”  So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.</p>

 <p>“Our ancestors had the tent of testimony in the wilderness, as God directed when he spoke to Moses, ordering him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.  Our ancestors in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors. And it was there until the time of David,  who found favor with God and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob.  But it was Solomon who built a house for him.  Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with human hands; as the prophet says,</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Heaven is my throne,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the earth is my footstool.</span><br>What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or what is the place of my rest?</span><br>Did not my hand make all these things?’</p></div> <p>“You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you are forever opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.  Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.  You are the ones that received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you have not kept it.”</p> <h3>The Stoning of Stephen</h3>
<p>When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen.  But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.  “Look,” he said, “I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”  But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him.  Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.  While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”  Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he died.  And Saul approved of their killing him.</p>
<h3>Saul Persecutes the Church</h3>
<p>That day a severe persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.  </p> <!--end of footnotes-->
