<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Revolt of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now Korah son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—descendants of Reuben—took  two hundred fifty Israelite men, leaders of the congregation, chosen from the assembly, well-known men, and they confronted Moses.  They assembled against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone too far! All the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is among them. So why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?”  When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.  Then he said to Korah and all his company, “In the morning the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will make known who is his, and who is holy, and who will be allowed to approach him; the one whom he will choose he will allow to approach him.  Do this: take censers, Korah and all your company,  and tomorrow put fire in them, and lay incense on them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the man whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chooses shall be the holy one. You Levites have gone too far!”  Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you Levites!  Is it too little for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to allow you to approach him in order to perform the duties of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation and serve them?  He has allowed you to approach him, and all your brother Levites with you; yet you seek the priesthood as well!  Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. What is Aaron that you rail against him?”</p> <p>Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab; but they said, “We will not come!  Is it too little that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also lord it over us?  It is clear you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come!”</p> <p>Moses was very angry and said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Pay no attention to their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed any one of them.”  And Moses said to Korah, “As for you and all your company, be present tomorrow before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, you and they and Aaron;  and let each one of you take his censer, and put incense on it, and each one of you present his censer before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.”  So each man took his censer, and they put fire in the censers and laid incense on them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.  Then Korah assembled the whole congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to the whole congregation.</p>

 <h3>The Apostles Heal Many</h3>
<p>Now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico.  None of the rest dared to join them, but the people held them in high esteem.  Yet more than ever believers were added to the Lord, great numbers of both men and women,  so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mats, in order that Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he came by.  A great number of people would also gather from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all cured.</p> <h3>The Apostles Are Persecuted</h3>
<p>Then the high priest took action; he and all who were with him (that is, the sect of the Sadducees), being filled with jealousy,  arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.  But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, brought them out, and said,  “Go, stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about this life.”  When they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and went on with their teaching.</p>
<p>When the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the council and the whole body of the elders of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.  But when the temple police went there, they did not find them in the prison; so they returned and reported,  “We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”  Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about them, wondering what might be going on.  Then someone arrived and announced, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”  Then the captain went with the temple police and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</p>
