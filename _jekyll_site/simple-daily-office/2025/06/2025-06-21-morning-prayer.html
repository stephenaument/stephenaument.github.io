<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.</p>
<h3>The Ark of God Captured</h3>
<p>In those days the Philistines mustered for war against Israel, and Israel went out to battle against them; they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.  The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle was joined, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.  When the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> here from Shiloh, so that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.”  So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p> <p>When the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.  When the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” When they learned that the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had come to the camp,  the Philistines were afraid; for they said, “Gods have come into the camp.” They also said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.  Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.  Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, in order not to become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.”</p> <p>So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated, and they fled, everyone to his home. There was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.  The ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</p>

 <h3>The Destruction of Jerusalem Foretold</h3>
<p>“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.  Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those inside the city must leave it, and those out in the country must not enter it;  for these are days of vengeance, as a fulfillment of all that is written.  Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people;  they will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken away as captives among all nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</p> <h3>The Coming of the Son of Man</h3>
<p>“There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves.  People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in a cloud’ with power and great glory.  Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”</p>
