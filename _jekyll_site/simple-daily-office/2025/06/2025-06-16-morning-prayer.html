<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samuel’s Birth and Dedication</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.  He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p> <p>Now this man used to go up year by year from his town to worship and to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;  but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed her womb.  Her rival used to provoke her severely, to irritate her, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had closed her womb.  So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.  Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”</p> <p>After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented herself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  She was deeply distressed and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and wept bitterly.  She made this vow: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, if only you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his head.”</p> <p>As she continued praying before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth.  Hannah was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk.  So Eli said to her, “How long will you make a drunken spectacle of yourself? Put away your wine.”  But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation all this time.”  Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.”  And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.</p> <p>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife Hannah, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> remembered her.  In due time Hannah conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, “I have asked him of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants</h3>
<p>He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenants, and went to another country for a long time.  When the season came, he sent a slave to the tenants in order that they might give him his share of the produce of the vineyard; but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.  Next he sent another slave; that one also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed.  And he sent still a third; this one also they wounded and threw out.  Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’  But when the tenants saw him, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.’  So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?  He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When they heard this, they said, “Heaven forbid!”  But he looked at them and said, “What then does this text mean:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The stone that the builders rejected<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>has become the cornerstone’?</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”  When the scribes and chief priests realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to lay hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people.</p>
