<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Budding of Aaron’s Rod</h3>
<p class="chapter-2"> The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the Israelites, and get twelve staffs from them, one for each ancestral house, from all the leaders of their ancestral houses. Write each man’s name on his staff,  and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each ancestral house.  Place them in the tent of meeting before the covenant, where I meet with you.  And the staff of the man whom I choose shall sprout; thus I will put a stop to the complaints of the Israelites that they continually make against you.  Moses spoke to the Israelites; and all their leaders gave him staffs, one for each leader, according to their ancestral houses, twelve staffs; and the staff of Aaron was among theirs.  So Moses placed the staffs before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the tent of the covenant.</p> <p>When Moses went into the tent of the covenant on the next day, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted. It put forth buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.  Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to all the Israelites; and they looked, and each man took his staff.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Put back the staff of Aaron before the covenant, to be kept as a warning to rebels, so that you may make an end of their complaints against me, or else they will die.”  Moses did so; just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him, so he did.</p>

<p> And all who sat in the council looked intently at him, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</p> <h3>Stephen’s Speech to the Council</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then the high priest asked him, “Are these things so?”  And Stephen replied:</p>
<p>“Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,  and said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land that I will show you.’  Then he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God had him move from there to this country in which you are now living.  He did not give him any of it as a heritage, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as his possession and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child.  And God spoke in these terms, that his descendants would be resident aliens in a country belonging to others, who would enslave them and mistreat them during four hundred years.  ‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’  Then he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</p> <p>“The patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him,  and rescued him from all his afflictions, and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.  Now there came a famine throughout Egypt and Canaan, and great suffering, and our ancestors could find no food.  But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there on their first visit.  On the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh.  Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him, seventy-five in all;  so Jacob went down to Egypt. He himself died there as well as our ancestors,  and their bodies were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
