<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Rejoice, young man, while you are young, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Follow the inclination of your heart and the desire of your eyes, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</p> <p>Banish anxiety from your mind, and put away pain from your body; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.</p> <p class="chapter-2">Remember your creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come, and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;  before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return with the rain;  in the day when the guards of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the women who grind cease working because they are few, and those who look through the windows see dimly;  when the doors on the street are shut, and the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;  when one is afraid of heights, and terrors are in the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along and desire fails; because all must go to their eternal home, and the mourners will go about the streets;  before the silver cord is snapped, and the golden bowl is broken, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel broken at the cistern,  and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the breath returns to God who gave it.  Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher; all is vanity.</p> <h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>Besides being wise, the Teacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging many proverbs.  The Teacher sought to find pleasing words, and he wrote words of truth plainly.</p> <p>The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings that are given by one shepherd.  Of anything beyond these, my child, beware. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p> <p>The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone.  For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Paul’s Concern for the Corinthian Church</h3>
<p>I have been a fool! You forced me to it. Indeed you should have been the ones commending me, for I am not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing.  The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, signs and wonders and mighty works.  How have you been worse off than the other churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!</p> <p>Here I am, ready to come to you this third time. And I will not be a burden, because I do not want what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children.  I will most gladly spend and be spent for you. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?  Let it be assumed that I did not burden you. Nevertheless (you say) since I was crafty, I took you in by deceit.  Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you?  I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?</p> <p>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you? We are speaking in Christ before God. Everything we do, beloved, is for the sake of building you up.  For I fear that when I come, I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish; I fear that there may perhaps be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.  I fear that when I come again, my God may humble me before you, and that I may have to mourn over many who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and licentiousness that they have practiced.</p>

<h3>17. The Song of Simeon <em class="latin_name">Nunc Dimittis</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *</p> <p class"indent">to go in peace as you have promised;</p> <p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *</p> <p class"indent">whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</p> <p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *</p> <p class"indent">and the glory of your people Israel.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class"indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>
 <p class="indent">creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>
 <p class="indent">He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
 <p class="indent2">and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
 <p class="indent2">was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
 <p class="indent">He descended to the dead.</p>
 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>
 <p class="indent">the forgiveness of sins,</p>
 <p class="indent">the resurrection of the body,</p>

Amen.
