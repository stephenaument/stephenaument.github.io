<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <p>In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
  <p>The sea is his, for he made it, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and his hands have molded the dry land.</p>
  <p class="space">Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
  <p>For he is our God,</p>
  <p>and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *</p>

 <p>The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.  But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and remain there forever; I will offer him as a nazirite for all time.”  Her husband Elkanah said to her, “Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only—may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> establish his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.  When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Shiloh; and the child was young.  Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.  And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  For this child I prayed; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has granted me the petition that I made to him.

<p>So they watched him and sent spies who pretended to be honest, in order to trap him by what he said, so as to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.  So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and you show deference to no one, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth.  Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?”  But he perceived their craftiness and said to them,  “Show me a denarius. Whose head and whose title does it bear?” They said, “The emperor’s.”  He said to them, “Then give to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”  And they were not able in the presence of the people to trap him by what he said; and being amazed by his answer, they became silent.</p>
