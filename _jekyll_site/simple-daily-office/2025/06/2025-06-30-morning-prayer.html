<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Saul Proclaimed King</h3>
<p>Samuel summoned the people to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at Mizpah  and said to them, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’  But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said, ‘No! but set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by your tribes and by your clans.”</p> <p>Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.  He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of the Matrites was taken by lot. Finally he brought the family of the Matrites near man by man, and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.  So they inquired again of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Did the man come here?” and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “See, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”  Then they ran and brought him from there. When he took his stand among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than any of them.  Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”</p> <p>Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship; and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Then Samuel sent all the people back to their homes.  Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went warriors whose hearts God had touched.  But some worthless fellows said, “How can this man save us?” They despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.</p>
<p>Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead.</p>

<p> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple police, and the elders who had come for him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?  When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!”</p> <h3>Peter Denies Jesus</h3>
<p>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance.  When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.  Then a servant-girl, seeing him in the firelight, stared at him and said, “This man also was with him.”  But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”  A little later someone else, on seeing him, said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”  Then about an hour later still another kept insisting, “Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.”  But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.  The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.”  And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>

for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
