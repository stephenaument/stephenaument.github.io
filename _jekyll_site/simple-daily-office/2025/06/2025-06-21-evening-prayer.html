<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <div class="passage-text">

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> Then the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against this people, for they are stronger than we.”  So they brought to the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out, saying, “The land that we have gone through as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are of great size.  There we saw the Nephilim (the Anakites come from the Nephilim); and to ourselves we seemed like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”</p> <h3>The People Rebel</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then all the congregation raised a loud cry, and the people wept that night.  And all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron; the whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!  Why is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become booty; would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?”  So they said to one another, “Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt.”</p> <p>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the Israelites.  And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes  and said to all the congregation of the Israelites, “The land that we went through as spies is an exceedingly good land.  If the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is pleased with us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey.  Only, do not rebel against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and do not fear the people of the land, for they are no more than bread for us; their protection is removed from them, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is with us; do not fear them.”  But the whole congregation threatened to stone them.</p>
<p>Then the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? And how long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?  I will strike them with pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”</p> <h3>Moses Intercedes for the People</h3>
<p>But Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for in your might you brought up this people from among them,  and they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are in the midst of this people; for you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them and you go in front of them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.  Now if you kill this people all at one time, then the nations who have heard about you will say,  ‘It is because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not able to bring this people into the land he swore to give them that he has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’  And now, therefore, let the power of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> be great in the way that you promised when you spoke, saying,</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is slow to anger,<br>and abounding in steadfast love,<br>forgiving iniquity and transgression,<br>but by no means clearing the guilty,<br>visiting the iniquity of the parents<br>upon the children<br>to the third and the fourth generation.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Forgive the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your steadfast love, just as you have pardoned this people, from Egypt even until now.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “I do forgive, just as you have asked;  nevertheless—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>—  none of the people who have seen my glory and the signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and yet have tested me these ten times and have not obeyed my voice,  shall see the land that I swore to give to their ancestors; none of those who despised me shall see it.  But my servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed me wholeheartedly, I will bring into the land into which he went, and his descendants shall possess it.  Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys, turn tomorrow and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>The Believers Share Their Possessions</h3>
<p>Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common.  With great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.  There was not a needy person among them, for as many as owned lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold.  They laid it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.  There was a Levite, a native of Cyprus, Joseph, to whom the apostles gave the name Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”).  He sold a field that belonged to him, then brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</p> <h3>Ananias and Sapphira</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">But a man named Ananias, with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property;  with his wife’s knowledge, he kept back some of the proceeds, and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles’ feet.  “Ananias,” Peter asked, “why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land?  While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, were not the proceeds at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You did not lie to us but to God!”  Now when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard of it.  The young men came and wrapped up his body, then carried him out and buried him.</p> <p>After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.  Peter said to her, “Tell me whether you and your husband sold the land for such and such a price.” And she said, “Yes, that was the price.”  Then Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.”  Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.  And great fear seized the whole church and all who heard of these things.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
