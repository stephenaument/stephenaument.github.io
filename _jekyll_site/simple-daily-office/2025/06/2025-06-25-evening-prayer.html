<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p> Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to take the censers out of the blaze; then scatter the fire far and wide.  For the censers of these sinners have become holy at the cost of their lives. Make them into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they presented them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and they became holy. Thus they shall be a sign to the Israelites.  So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been presented by those who were burned; and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar—  a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, shall approach to offer incense before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, so as not to become like Korah and his company—just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to him through Moses.</p> <p>On the next day, however, the whole congregation of the Israelites rebelled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  And when the congregation had assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting; the cloud had covered it and the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared.  Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,  and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying,  “Get away from this congregation, so that I may consume them in a moment.” And they fell on their faces.  Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire on it from the altar and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them. For wrath has gone out from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; the plague has begun.”  So Aaron took it as Moses had ordered, and ran into the middle of the assembly, where the plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.  He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.  Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.  When the plague was stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</p>

 <h3>Seven Chosen to Serve</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now during those days, when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.  And the twelve called together the whole community of the disciples and said, “It is not right that we should neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.  Therefore, friends, select from among yourselves seven men of good standing, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this task,  while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer and to serving the word.”  What they said pleased the whole community, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, together with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch.  They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</p> <p>The word of God continued to spread; the number of the disciples increased greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.</p> <h3>The Arrest of Stephen</h3>
<p>Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.  Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and others of those from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen.  But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.  Then they secretly instigated some men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”  They stirred up the people as well as the elders and the scribes; then they suddenly confronted him, seized him, and brought him before the council.  They set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops saying things against this holy place and the law;  for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed on to us.”  And all who sat in the council looked intently at him, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</p>
