<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Individual Retribution</h3>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of humans and the seed of animals.  And just as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  In those days they shall no longer say:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The parents have eaten sour grapes,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the children’s teeth are set on edge.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But all shall die for their own sins; the teeth of everyone who eats sour grapes shall be set on edge.</p> <h3>A New Covenant</h3>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.  It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt—a covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  No longer shall they teach one another, or say to each other, “Know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,” for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more.</p>

 <h3>Mediator of a Better Covenant</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,  a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the Lord, and not any mortal, has set up.  For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.  Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.  They offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one; for Moses, when he was about to erect the tent, was warned, “See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”  But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted through better promises.  For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.</p> <p>God finds fault with them when he says:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The days are surely coming, says the Lord,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and with the house of Judah;</span><br>not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;</span><br>for they did not continue in my covenant,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and so I had no concern for them, says the Lord.</span><br>This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>after those days, says the Lord:</span><br>I will put my laws in their minds,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and write them on their hearts,</span><br>and I will be their God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and they shall be my people.</span><br>And they shall not teach one another<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or say to each other, ‘Know the Lord,’</span><br>for they shall all know me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>from the least of them to the greatest.</span><br>For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I will remember their sins no more.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">In speaking of “a new covenant,” he has made the first one obsolete. And what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear.</p>
