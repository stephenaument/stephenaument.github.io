<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Samuel as Judge</h3>
<p>Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Astartes from among you. Direct your heart to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”  So Israel put away the Baals and the Astartes, and they served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> only.</p> <p>Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for you.”  So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. They fasted that day, and said, “We have sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.</p> <p>When the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines.  The people of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God for us, and pray that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”  So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; Samuel cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for Israel, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> answered him.  As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel; but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> thundered with a mighty voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion; and they were routed before Israel.  And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as beyond Beth-car.</p> <p>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jeshanah, and named it Ebenezer; for he said, “Thus far the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has helped us.”  So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel; the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.  The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.</p> <p>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  He went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these places.  Then he would come back to Ramah, for his home was there; he administered justice there to Israel, and built there an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>The Institution of the Lord’s Supper</h3>
<p>When the hour came, he took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.  He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;  for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”  Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves;  for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”  Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”  And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.  But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table.  For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!”  Then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this.</p>
