<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Day of Atonement</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and died.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses:</p>
<p>Tell your brother Aaron not to come just at any time into the sanctuary inside the curtain before the mercy seat that is upon the ark, or he will die; for I appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.  Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.  He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and shall have the linen undergarments next to his body, fasten the linen sash, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy vestments. He shall bathe his body in water, and then put them on.  He shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</p> <p>Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house.  He shall take the two goats and set them before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> at the entrance of the tent of meeting;  and Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats, one lot for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and the other lot for Azazel.  Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and offer it as a sin offering;  but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.</p> <p>Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house; he shall slaughter the bull as a sin offering for himself.  He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and two handfuls of crushed sweet incense, and he shall bring it inside the curtain  and put the incense on the fire before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the covenant, or he will die.  He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times.</p> <p>He shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the curtain, and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.  Thus he shall make atonement for the sanctuary, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel, and because of their transgressions, all their sins; and so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which remains with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.  No one shall be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the sanctuary until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel.  Then he shall go out to the altar that is before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and make atonement on its behalf, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat, and put it on each of the horns of the altar.  He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.</p>

  <p>I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; *</p> <p class="indent">the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.</p> <p>The Lord is my strength and my refuge; *</p> <p class="indent">the Lord has become my Savior.</p> <p>This is my God and I will praise him, *</p> <p class="indent">the God of my people and I will exalt him.</p> <p>The Lord is a mighty warrior; *</p> <p class="indent">Yahweh is his Name.</p> <p>The chariots of Pharaoh and his army has he hurled into the sea; *</p> <p class="indent">the finest of those who bear armor have been drowned in the Red Sea.</p> <p>The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; *</p> <p class="indent">they sank into the depths like a stone.</p> <p>Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; *</p> <p class="indent">your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.</p> <p>Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? *</p> <p class="indent">who is like you, glorious in holiness,</p> <p class="indent">awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?</p> <p>You stretched forth your right hand; *</p> <p class="indent">the earth swallowed them up.</p> <p>With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *</p> <p class="indent">with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.</p> <p>You will bring them in and plant them *</p> <p class="indent">on the mount of your possession,</p> <p>The resting-place you have made for yourself, O Lord, *</p> <p class="indent">the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hand has established.</p> <p>The Lord shall reign *</p> <p class="indent">for ever and for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <h3>Rules for Christian Households</h3>
<p>Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.  Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.</p> <p>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is your acceptable duty in the Lord.  Fathers, do not provoke your children, or they may lose heart.  Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched and in order to please them, but wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord.  Whatever your task, put yourselves into it, as done for the Lord and not for your masters,  since you know that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward; you serve the Lord Christ.  For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done, and there is no partiality.  Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, for you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</p> <h3>Further Instructions</h3>
<p>Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving.  At the same time pray for us as well that God will open to us a door for the word, that we may declare the mystery of Christ, for which I am in prison,  so that I may reveal it clearly, as I should.</p> <p>Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time.  Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone.</p> <h3>Final Greetings and Benediction</h3>
<p>Tychicus will tell you all the news about me; he is a beloved brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.  I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts;  he is coming with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.</p> <p>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom you have received instructions—if he comes to you, welcome him.  And Jesus who is called Justus greets you. These are the only ones of the circumcision among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you. He is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that God wills.  For I testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.  Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.  And when this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you read also the letter from Laodicea.  And say to Archippus, “See that you complete the task that you have received in the Lord.”</p> <p class="top-1">I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
