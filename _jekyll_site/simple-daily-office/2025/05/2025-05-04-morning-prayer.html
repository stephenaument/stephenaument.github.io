<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>Nebuchadnezzar’s Second Dream</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages that live throughout the earth: May you have abundant prosperity!  The signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked for me I am pleased to recount.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">How great are his signs,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>how mighty his wonders!</span><br>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his sovereignty is from generation to generation.</span></p></div> <p> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living at ease in my home and prospering in my palace.  I saw a dream that frightened me; my fantasies in bed and the visions of my head terrified me.  So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, in order that they might tell me the interpretation of the dream.  Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not tell me its interpretation.  At last Daniel came in before me—he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and who is endowed with a spirit of the holy gods—and I told him the dream:  “O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that you are endowed with a spirit of the holy gods and that no mystery is too difficult for you. Hear the dream that I saw; tell me its interpretation.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line"> Upon my bed this is what I saw;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there was a tree at the center of the earth,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and its height was great.</span><br>The tree grew great and strong,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>its top reached to heaven,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and it was visible to the ends of the whole earth.</span><br>Its foliage was beautiful,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>its fruit abundant,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and it provided food for all.</span><br>The animals of the field found shade under it,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the birds of the air nested in its branches,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and from it all living beings were fed.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">“I continued looking, in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and there was a holy watcher, coming down from heaven.  He cried aloud and said:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Cut down the tree and chop off its branches,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit.</span><br>Let the animals flee from beneath it<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the birds from its branches.</span><br>But leave its stump and roots in the ground,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>with a band of iron and bronze,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the tender grass of the field.</span><br>Let him be bathed with the dew of heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and let his lot be with the animals of the field</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the grass of the earth.</span><br>Let his mind be changed from that of a human,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and let the mind of an animal be given to him.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>And let seven times pass over him.</span><br>The sentence is rendered by decree of the watchers,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the decision is given by order of the holy ones,</span><br>in order that all who live may know<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of mortals;</span><br>he gives it to whom he will<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and sets over it the lowliest of human beings.’</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">“This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to tell me the interpretation. You are able, however, for you are endowed with a spirit of the holy gods.”</p>

 <h3>Jesus and Peter</h3>
<p>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.”  A second time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.”  He said to him the third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter felt hurt because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep.  Very truly, I tell you, when you were younger, you used to fasten your own belt and to go wherever you wished. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go.”  (He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he would glorify God.) After this he said to him, “Follow me.”</p> <h3>Jesus and the Beloved Disciple</h3>
<p>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; he was the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?”  When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”  Jesus said to him, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!”  So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”</p> <p>This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.  But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if every one of them were written down, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</p>
