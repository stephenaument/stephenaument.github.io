<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Festival of Trumpets</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of complete rest, a holy convocation commemorated with trumpet blasts.  You shall not work at your occupations; and you shall present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offering by fire.</p> <h3>The Day of Atonement</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Now, the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you: you shall deny yourselves and present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offering by fire;  and you shall do no work during that entire day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  For anyone who does not practice self-denial during that entire day shall be cut off from the people.  And anyone who does any work during that entire day, such a one I will destroy from the midst of the people.  You shall do no work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your settlements.  It shall be to you a sabbath of complete rest, and you shall deny yourselves; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening you shall keep your sabbath.</p> <h3>The Festival of Booths</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, and lasting seven days, there shall be the festival of booths to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not work at your occupations.  Seven days you shall present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offerings by fire; on the eighth day you shall observe a holy convocation and present the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s offerings by fire; it is a solemn assembly; you shall not work at your occupations.</p> <p>These are the appointed festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which you shall celebrate as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> offerings by fire—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day—  apart from the sabbaths of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your votive offerings, and apart from all your freewill offerings, which you give to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Now, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall keep the festival of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, lasting seven days; a complete rest on the first day, and a complete rest on the eighth day.  On the first day you shall take the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God for seven days.  You shall keep it as a festival to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> seven days in the year; you shall keep it in the seventh month as a statute forever throughout your generations.  You shall live in booths for seven days; all that are citizens in Israel shall live in booths,  so that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p> <p>Thus Moses declared to the people of Israel the appointed festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>Please Others, Not Yourselves</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">We who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.  Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor.  For Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”  For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.  May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,  so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <h3>The Gospel for Jews and Gentiles Alike</h3>
<p>Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.  For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,  and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and sing praises to your name”;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">and again he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people”;</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">and again,</p>

<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The root of Jesse shall come,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the one who rises to rule the Gentiles;</span><br>in him the Gentiles shall hope.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
