<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>You shall keep the festival of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.</p> <p>All that first opens the womb is mine, all your male livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.  The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.</p>
<p>No one shall appear before me empty-handed.</p> <p>Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in plowing time and in harvest time you shall rest.  You shall observe the festival of weeks, the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the festival of ingathering at the turn of the year.  Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God, the God of Israel.  For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders; no one shall covet your land when you go up to appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God three times in the year.</p> <p>You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, and the sacrifice of the festival of the passover shall not be left until the morning.</p> <p>The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>
<p>You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses: Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.  He was there with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p> <h3>The Shining Face of Moses</h3>
<p>Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.  When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.  But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them.  Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.  When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face;  but whenever Moses went in before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to speak with him, he would take the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,  the Israelites would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>

 <h3>The New Life in Christ</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.  Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth,  for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.  When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.</p> <p>Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry).  On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.  These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life.  But now you must get rid of all such things—anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth.  Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices  and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator.  In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!</p>
