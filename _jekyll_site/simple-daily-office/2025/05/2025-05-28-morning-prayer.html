<h3 class="title">Wednesday In The Week Of 6 Easter</h3>


<div class="citation">Hebrews 9:24</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<div class="citation">Deut 8:11-20</div>
<h3>Deut 8:11-20</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Take care that you do not forget the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today.  When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them,  and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied,  then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,  who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock,  and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good.  Do not say to yourself, “My power and the might of my own hand have gotten me this wealth.”  But remember the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors, as he is doing today.  If you do forget the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and follow other gods to serve and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.  Like the nations that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is destroying before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

  <p>Arise, shine, for your light has come, *</p> <p class="indent">and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.</p> <p>For behold, darkness covers the land; *</p> <p class="indent">deep gloom enshrouds the peoples.</p> <p>But over you the Lord will rise, *</p> <p class="indent">and his glory will appear upon you.</p> <p>Nations will stream to your light, *</p> <p class="indent">and kings to the brightness of your dawning.</p> <p>Your gates will always be open; *</p> <p class="indent">by day or night they will never be shut.</p> <p>They will call you, The City of the Lord, *</p> <p class="indent">The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p> <p>Violence will no more be heard in your land, *</p> <p class="indent">ruin or destruction within your borders.</p> <p>You will call your walls, Salvation, *</p> <p class="indent">and all your portals, Praise.</p> <p>The sun will no more be your light by day; *</p> <p class="indent">by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.</p> <p>The Lord will be your everlasting light, *</p> <p class="indent">and your God will be your glory.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>James 1:16-27</h3>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> Do not be deceived, my beloved.</p> <p>Every generous act of giving, with every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.  In fulfillment of his own purpose he gave us birth by the word of truth, so that we would become a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</p> <h3>Hearing and Doing the Word</h3>
<p>You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger;  for your anger does not produce God’s righteousness.  Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls.</p> <p>But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.  For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror;  for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like.  But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act—they will be blessed in their doing.</p> <p>If any think they are religious, and do not bridle their tongues but deceive their hearts, their religion is worthless.  Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>
