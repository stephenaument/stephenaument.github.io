<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Moses Makes New Tablets</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you broke.  Be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself there to me, on the top of the mountain.  No one shall come up with you, and do not let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; and do not let flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.”  So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the former ones; and he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tablets of stone.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> passed before him, and proclaimed,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,<br>a God merciful and gracious,<br>slow to anger,<br>and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,<br>keeping steadfast love for the thousandth generation,<br>forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,<br>yet by no means clearing the guilty,<br>but visiting the iniquity of the parents<br>upon the children<br>and the children’s children,<br>to the third and the fourth generation.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.  He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”</p> <h3>The Covenant Renewed</h3>
<p>He said: I hereby make a covenant. Before all your people I will perform marvels, such as have not been performed in all the earth or in any nation; and all the people among whom you live shall see the work of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; for it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.</p> <p>Observe what I command you today. See, I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  Take care not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, or it will become a snare among you.  You shall tear down their altars, break their pillars, and cut down their sacred poles  (for you shall worship no other god, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God).  You shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, someone among them will invite you, and you will eat of the sacrifice.  And you will take wives from among their daughters for your sons, and their daughters who prostitute themselves to their gods will make your sons also prostitute themselves to their gods.</p> <p>You shall not make cast idols.</p>

<h3>Col 2:8-23</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="top-1">See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ.  For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,  and you have come to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority.  In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision, by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ;  when you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.  And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, when he forgave us all our trespasses,  erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.  He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in it.</p> <p>Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals, new moons, or sabbaths.  These are only a shadow of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.  Do not let anyone disqualify you, insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking,  and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.</p> <h3>Warnings against False Teachers</h3>
<p>If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations,  “Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch”?  All these regulations refer to things that perish with use; they are simply human commands and teachings.  These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-imposed piety, humility, and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value in checking self-indulgence.</p>
