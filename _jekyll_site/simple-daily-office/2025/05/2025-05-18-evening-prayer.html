<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Rites of Ordination</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:  Take Aaron and his sons with him, the vestments, the anointing oil, the bull of sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;  and assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.  And Moses did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting,  Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded to be done.”</p> <p>Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward, and washed them with water.  He put the tunic on him, fastened the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He then put the decorated band of the ephod around him, tying the ephod to him with it.  He placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim.  And he set the turban on his head, and on the turban, in front, he set the golden ornament, the holy crown, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p> <p>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.  He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its base, to consecrate them.  He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.  And Moses brought forward Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and fastened sashes around them, and tied headdresses on them, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses.</p>

 <p>Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his vestments, and also on his sons and their vestments. Thus he consecrated Aaron and his vestments, and also his sons and their vestments.</p> <p>And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it’;  and what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn with fire.  You shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day when your period of ordination is completed. For it will take seven days to ordain you;  as has been done today, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded to be done to make atonement for you.  You shall remain at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, keeping the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s charge so that you do not die; for so I am commanded.”  Aaron and his sons did all the things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded through Moses.</p>

 <h3>Chosen for Salvation</h3>
<p>But we must always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.  For this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</p> <p>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,  comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word.</p>
