<div class="citation">Colossians 3:1</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

*</p><p class="indent">he provided for them food enough.</p><p>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens *</p><p class="indent">and led out the south wind by his might.</p><p class="space">He rained down flesh upon them like dust *</p><p class="indent">and wing√®d birds like the sand of the sea.</p><p class="space">He let it fall in the midst of their camp *</p><p class="indent">and round about their dwellings.</p><p class="space">So they ate and were well filled, *</p><p class="indent">for he gave them what they craved.</p><p class="space">But they did not stop their craving, *</p><p class="indent">though the food was still in their mouths.</p><p class="space">So God's anger mounted against them; *</p><p class="indent">he slew their strongest men</p><p class="indent">and laid low the youth of Israel.</p><p class="space">In spite of all this, they went on sinning *</p><p class="indent">and had no faith in his wonderful works.</p><p class="space">So he brought their days to an end like a breath *</p><p class="indent">and their years in sudden terror.</p><p class="space">Whenever he slew them, they would seek him, *</p><p class="indent">and repent, and diligently search for God.</p><p class="space">They would remember that God was their rock, *</p><p class="indent">and the Most High God their redeemer.</p><p class="space">But they flattered him with their mouths *</p><p class="indent">and lied to him with their tongues.</p><p class="space">Their heart was not steadfast toward him, *</p><p class="indent">and they were not faithful to his covenant.</p><p>But he was so merciful that he forgave their sins</p><p>and did not destroy them; *</p><p class="indent">many times he held back his anger</p><p class="indent">and did not permit his wrath to be roused.</p><p class="space">For he remembered that they were but flesh, *</p><p class="indent">a breath that goes forth and does not return.</p>

  <p> Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Take care that you do not forget the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today.  When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them,  and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied,  then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,  who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland with poisonous snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock,  and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good.  Do not say to yourself, ‚ÄúMy power and the might of my own hand have gotten me this wealth.‚Äù  But remember the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors, as he is doing today.  If you do forget the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and follow other gods to serve and worship them, I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.  Like the nations that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is destroying before you, so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

 <h3>The Lord‚Äôs Prayer</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">He was praying in a certain place, and after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.‚Äù  He said to them, ‚ÄúWhen you pray, say:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">Father, hallowed be your name.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">¬†¬†¬†¬†</span>Your kingdom come.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">¬†¬†¬†¬†</span>Give us each day our daily bread.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">¬†¬†¬†¬†</span>And forgive us our sins,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†</span>for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">¬†¬†¬†¬†</span>And do not bring us to the time of trial.‚Äù</span></p></div> <h3>Perseverance in Prayer</h3>
<p>And he said to them, ‚ÄúSuppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‚ÄòFriend, lend me three loaves of bread;  for a friend of mine has arrived, and I have nothing to set before him.‚Äô  And he answers from within, ‚ÄòDo not bother me; the door has already been locked, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.‚Äô  I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.</p> <p>‚ÄúSo I say to you, Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.  For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.  Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for a fish, will give a snake instead of a fish?  Or if the child asks for an egg, will give a scorpion?  If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!‚Äù</p>
