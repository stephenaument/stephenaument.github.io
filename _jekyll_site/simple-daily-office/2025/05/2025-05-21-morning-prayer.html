<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>The Foolishness of Nature Worship</h3>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line"><span class="chapter-2">For all people who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature;</span><br>and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know the one who exists,<br>nor did they recognize the artisan while paying heed to his works;<br>but they supposed that either fire or wind or swift air,<br>or the circle of the stars, or turbulent water,<br>or the luminaries of heaven were the gods that rule the world.<br>If through delight in the beauty of these things people assumed them to be gods,<br>let them know how much better than these is their Lord,<br>for the author of beauty created them.<br>And if people were amazed at their power and working,<br>let them perceive from them<br>how much more powerful is the one who formed them.<br>For from the greatness and beauty of created things<br>comes a corresponding perception of their Creator.<br>Yet these people are little to be blamed,<br>for perhaps they go astray<br>while seeking God and desiring to find him.<br>For while they live among his works, they keep searching,<br>and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful.<br>Yet again, not even they are to be excused;<br>for if they had the power to know so much<br>that they could investigate the world,<br>how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things?</p></div>

 <h3>A Lamp under a Jar</h3>
<p>“No one after lighting a lamp hides it under a jar, or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.  For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed, nor is anything secret that will not become known and come to light.  Then pay attention to how you listen; for to those who have, more will be given; and from those who do not have, even what they seem to have will be taken away.”</p> <h3>The True Kindred of Jesus</h3>
<p>Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.  And he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”  But he said to them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”</p> <h3>Jesus Calms a Storm</h3>
<p>One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.” So they put out,  and while they were sailing he fell asleep. A windstorm swept down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.  They went to him and woke him up, shouting, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they ceased, and there was a calm.  He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were afraid and amazed, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”</p>
