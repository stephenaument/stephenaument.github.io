<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Offerings for the Tabernacle</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses:  Tell the Israelites to take for me an offering; from all whose hearts prompt them to give you shall receive the offering for me.  This is the offering that you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze,  blue, purple, and crimson yarns and fine linen, goats’ hair,  tanned rams’ skins, fine leather, acacia wood,  oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,  onyx stones and gems to be set in the ephod and for the breastpiece.  And have them make me a sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them.  In accordance with all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.</p> <h3>The Ark of the Covenant</h3>
<p>They shall make an ark of acacia wood; it shall be two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.  You shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and outside you shall overlay it, and you shall make a molding of gold upon it all around.  You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its four feet, two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side.  You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.  And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, by which to carry the ark.  The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.  You shall put into the ark the covenant that I shall give you.</p> <p>Then you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its width.  You shall make two cherubim of gold; you shall make them of hammered work, at the two ends of the mercy seat.  Make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other; of one piece with the mercy seat you shall make the cherubim at its two ends.  The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings. They shall face one to another; the faces of the cherubim shall be turned toward the mercy seat.  You shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark; and in the ark you shall put the covenant that I shall give you.  There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the covenant, I will deliver to you all my commands for the Israelites.</p>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p>The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</p> <h3>Gaius Commended for His Hospitality</h3>
<p>Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, just as it is well with your soul.  I was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth, namely how you walk in the truth.  I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are walking in the truth.</p> <p>Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends, even though they are strangers to you;  they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of God;  for they began their journey for the sake of Christ, accepting no support from non-believers.  Therefore we ought to support such people, so that we may become co-workers with the truth.</p> <h3>Diotrephes and Demetrius</h3>
<p>I have written something to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority.  So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us. And not content with those charges, he refuses to welcome the friends, and even prevents those who want to do so and expels them from the church.</p> <p>Beloved, do not imitate what is evil but imitate what is good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.  Everyone has testified favorably about Demetrius, and so has the truth itself. We also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true.</p> <h3>Final Greetings</h3>
<p>I have much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink;  instead I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face.</p> <p>Peace to you. The friends send you their greetings. Greet the friends there, each by name.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
