<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Exaltation through Abasement</h3>
<p>Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.  But someone has testified somewhere,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What are human beings that you are mindful of them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or mortals, that you care for them?</span><br>You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you have crowned them with glory and honor,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>subjecting all things under their feet.”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them,  but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p> <p>It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,  saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will put my trust in him.”</p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">And again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Here am I and the children whom God has given me.”</p></div> <p>Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,  and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.  For it is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of Abraham.  Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.  Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.</p>
