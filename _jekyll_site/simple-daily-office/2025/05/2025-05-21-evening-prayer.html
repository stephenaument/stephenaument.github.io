<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Ritual and Moral Holiness</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses, saying:</p> <p>Speak to all the congregation of the people of Israel and say to them: You shall be holy, for I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God am holy.  You shall each revere your mother and father, and you shall keep my sabbaths: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  Do not turn to idols or make cast images for yourselves: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p> <p>When you offer a sacrifice of well-being to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, offer it in such a way that it is acceptable in your behalf.  It shall be eaten on the same day you offer it, or on the next day; and anything left over until the third day shall be consumed in fire.  If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it will not be acceptable.  All who eat it shall be subject to punishment, because they have profaned what is holy to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and any such person shall be cut off from the people.</p> <p>When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edges of your field, or gather the gleanings of your harvest.  You shall not strip your vineyard bare, or gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the alien: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p> <p>You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; and you shall not lie to one another.  And you shall not swear falsely by my name, profaning the name of your God: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>You shall not defraud your neighbor; you shall not steal; and you shall not keep for yourself the wages of a laborer until morning.  You shall not revile the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind; you shall fear your God: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>You shall not render an unjust judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great: with justice you shall judge your neighbor.  You shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not profit by the blood of your neighbor: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>You shall not hate in your heart anyone of your kin; you shall reprove your neighbor, or you will incur guilt yourself.  You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>Being Subject to Authorities</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; for there is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted by God.  Therefore whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.  For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you wish to have no fear of the authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive its approval;  for it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for the authority does not bear the sword in vain! It is the servant of God to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.  Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.  For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, busy with this very thing.  Pay to all what is due them—taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</p> <h3>Love for One Another</h3>
<p>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.  The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not covet”; and any other commandment, are summed up in this word, “Love your neighbor as yourself.”  Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law.</p> <h3>An Urgent Appeal</h3>
<p>Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers;  the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light;  let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.  Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</p>
