<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>If any of your kin fall into difficulty and become dependent on you, you shall support them; they shall live with you as though resident aliens.  Do not take interest in advance or otherwise make a profit from them, but fear your God; let them live with you.  You shall not lend them your money at interest taken in advance, or provide them food at a profit.  I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.</p> <p>If any who are dependent on you become so impoverished that they sell themselves to you, you shall not make them serve as slaves.  They shall remain with you as hired or bound laborers. They shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.  Then they and their children with them shall be free from your authority; they shall go back to their own family and return to their ancestral property.  For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.  You shall not rule over them with harshness, but shall fear your God.  As for the male and female slaves whom you may have, it is from the nations around you that you may acquire male and female slaves.  You may also acquire them from among the aliens residing with you, and from their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property.  You may keep them as a possession for your children after you, for them to inherit as property. These you may treat as slaves, but as for your fellow Israelites, no one shall rule over the other with harshness.</p> <p>If resident aliens among you prosper, and if any of your kin fall into difficulty with one of them and sell themselves to an alien, or to a branch of the alien’s family,  after they have sold themselves they shall have the right of redemption; one of their brothers may redeem them,  or their uncle or their uncle’s son may redeem them, or anyone of their family who is of their own flesh may redeem them; or if they prosper they may redeem themselves.  They shall compute with the purchaser the total from the year when they sold themselves to the alien until the jubilee year; the price of the sale shall be applied to the number of years: the time they were with the owner shall be rated as the time of a hired laborer.  If many years remain, they shall pay for their redemption in proportion to the purchase price;  and if few years remain until the jubilee year, they shall compute thus: according to the years involved they shall make payment for their redemption.  As a laborer hired by the year they shall be under the alien’s authority, who shall not, however, rule with harshness over them in your sight.  And if they have not been redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children with them shall go free in the jubilee year.  For to me the people of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion:</p>
<p>Greetings.</p> <h3>Faith and Wisdom</h3>
<p>My brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of any kind, consider it nothing but joy,  because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance;  and let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing.</p> <p>If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly, and it will be given you.  But ask in faith, never doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind;  for the doubter, being double-minded and unstable in every way, must not expect to receive anything from the Lord.</p> <h3>Poverty and Riches</h3>
<p>Let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up,  and the rich in being brought low, because the rich will disappear like a flower in the field.  For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. It is the same way with the rich; in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away.</p> <h3>Trial and Temptation</h3>
<p>Blessed is anyone who endures temptation. Such a one has stood the test and will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.  No one, when tempted, should say, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one.  But one is tempted by one’s own desire, being lured and enticed by it;  then, when that desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and that sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.  </p>
