<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Ten Commandments</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then God spoke all these words:</p> <p>I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery;  you shall have no other gods before me.</p> <p>You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.  You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me,  but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p> <p>You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will not acquit anyone who misuses his name.</p> <p>Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy.  Six days you shall labor and do all your work.  But the seventh day is a sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns.  For in six days the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it.</p> <p>Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving you.</p> <p>You shall not murder.</p> <p>You shall not commit adultery.</p> <p>You shall not steal.</p> <p>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</p> <p>You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.</p> <p>When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance,  and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die.”  Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin.”  Then the people stood at a distance, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.</p>

 <h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.</p> <p>And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.  And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him.  If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one—to those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that.  All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal.</p> <p>We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one does not touch them.  We know that we are God’s children, and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one.  And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</p> <p>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
