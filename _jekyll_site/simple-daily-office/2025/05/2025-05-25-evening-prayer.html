<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Sabbatical Year</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying:  Speak to the people of Israel and say to them: When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land shall observe a sabbath for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in their yield;  but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of complete rest for the land, a sabbath for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: you shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.  You shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your unpruned vine: it shall be a year of complete rest for the land.  You may eat what the land yields during its sabbath—you, your male and female slaves, your hired and your bound laborers who live with you;  for your livestock also, and for the wild animals in your land all its yield shall be for food.</p> <h3>The Year of Jubilee</h3>
<p>You shall count off seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the period of seven weeks of years gives forty-nine years.  Then you shall have the trumpet sounded loud; on the tenth day of the seventh month—on the day of atonement—you shall have the trumpet sounded throughout all your land.  And you shall hallow the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you: you shall return, every one of you, to your property and every one of you to your family.  That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you: you shall not sow, or reap the aftergrowth, or harvest the unpruned vines.  For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you: you shall eat only what the field itself produces.</p> <p>In this year of jubilee you shall return, every one of you, to your property.  When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not cheat one another.  When you buy from your neighbor, you shall pay only for the number of years since the jubilee; the seller shall charge you only for the remaining crop years.  If the years are more, you shall increase the price, and if the years are fewer, you shall diminish the price; for it is a certain number of harvests that are being sold to you.  You shall not cheat one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.</p>

 <h3>The Mystery of Our Religion</h3>
<p>I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these instructions to you so that,  if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth.  Without any doubt, the mystery of our religion is great:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">He was revealed in flesh,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>vindicated in spirit,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>seen by angels,</span><br>proclaimed among Gentiles,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>believed in throughout the world,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>taken up in glory.</span></p></div> <h3>False Asceticism</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,  through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron.  They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.  For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, provided it is received with thanksgiving;  for it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>
 <p class="indent">creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>
 <p class="indent">He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
 <p class="indent2">and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
 <p class="indent2">was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
 <p class="indent">He descended to the dead.</p>
 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>
 <p class="indent">the forgiveness of sins,</p>
 <p class="indent">the resurrection of the body,</p>

<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
