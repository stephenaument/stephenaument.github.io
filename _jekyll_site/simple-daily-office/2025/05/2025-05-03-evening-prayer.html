<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Water from the Rock</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.  The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?”  But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?”  So Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.  I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.  He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying, “Is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> among us or not?”</p> <h3>Amalek Attacks Israel and Is Defeated</h3>
<p>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.  Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some men for us and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”  So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.  Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.  But Moses’ hands grew weary; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; so his hands were steady until the sun set.  And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Write this as a reminder in a book and recite it in the hearing of Joshua: I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.”  And Moses built an altar and called it, The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is my banner.  He said, “A hand upon the banner of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”</p>

 <h3>Love One Another</h3>
<p>For this is the message you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  We must not be like Cain who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother’s righteous.  Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, that the world hates you.  We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another. Whoever does not love abides in death.  All who hate a brother or sister are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them.  We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us—and we ought to lay down our lives for one another.  How does God’s love abide in anyone who has the world’s goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?</p> <p>Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.  </p>
