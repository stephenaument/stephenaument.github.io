<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, as well as a thick cloud on the mountain, and a blast of a trumpet so loud that all the people who were in the camp trembled.  Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God. They took their stand at the foot of the mountain.  Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had descended upon it in fire; the smoke went up like the smoke of a kiln, while the whole mountain shook violently.  As the blast of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses would speak and God would answer him in thunder.  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> descended upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people not to break through to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to look; otherwise many of them will perish.  Even the priests who approach the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> must consecrate themselves or the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will break out against them.”  Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “The people are not permitted to come up to Mount Sinai; for you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and keep it holy.’”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you; but do not let either the priests or the people break through to come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; otherwise he will break out against them.”  So Moses went down to the people and told them.</p>

 <h3>Faith Conquers the World</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child.  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.  For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,  for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith.  Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p> <h3>Testimony concerning the Son of God</h3>
<p>This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth.  There are three that testify:  the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree.  If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son.  Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.  And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>
