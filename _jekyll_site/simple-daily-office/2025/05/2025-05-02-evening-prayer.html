<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<p> he said to them, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.’”  So they put it aside until morning, as Moses commanded them; and it did not become foul, and there were no worms in it.  Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; today you will not find it in the field.  Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a sabbath, there will be none.”</p> <p>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and instructions?  See! The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day he gives you food for two days; each of you stay where you are; do not leave your place on the seventh day.”  So the people rested on the seventh day.</p> <p>The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.  Moses said, “This is what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, in order that they may see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”  And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to be kept throughout your generations.”  As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the covenant, for safekeeping.  The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land; they ate manna, until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.  An omer is a tenth of an ephah.</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.  Beloved, we are God’s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is.  And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.</p> <p>Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.  Everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.  Those who have been born of God do not sin, because God’s seed abides in them; they cannot sin, because they have been born of God.  The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way: all who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters.</p>

and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>

And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
