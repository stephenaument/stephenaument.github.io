<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jethro’s Advice</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had brought Israel out of Egypt.  After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro took her back,  along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (for he said, “I have been an alien in a foreign land”),  and the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).  Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came into the wilderness where Moses was encamped at the mountain of God, bringing Moses’ sons and wife to him.  He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, with your wife and her two sons.”  Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed down and kissed him; each asked after the other’s welfare, and they went into the tent.  Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had beset them on the way, and how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had delivered them.  Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had done to Israel, in delivering them from the Egyptians.</p> <p>Jethro said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who has delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh.  Now I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is greater than all gods, because he delivered the people from the Egyptians, when they dealt arrogantly with them.”  And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.</p>

 <p>The end of all things is near; therefore be serious and discipline yourselves for the sake of your prayers.  Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins.  Be hospitable to one another without complaining.  Like good stewards of the manifold grace of God, serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received.  Whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of God; whoever serves must do so with the strength that God supplies, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</p>
