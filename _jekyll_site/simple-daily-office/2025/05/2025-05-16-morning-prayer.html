<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>Description of Wisdom</h3>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">Wisdom is radiant and unfading,<br>and she is easily discerned by those who love her,<br>and is found by those who seek her.<br>She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her.<br>One who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty,<br>for she will be found sitting at the gate.<br>To fix one’s thought on her is perfect understanding,<br>and one who is vigilant on her account will soon be free from care,<br>because she goes about seeking those worthy of her,<br>and she graciously appears to them in their paths,<br>and meets them in every thought.</p></div> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere desire for instruction,<br>and concern for instruction is love of her,<br>and love of her is the keeping of her laws,<br>and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality,<br>and immortality brings one near to God;<br>so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.</p></div> <div class="poetry top-1">
<p class="line">Therefore if you delight in thrones and scepters, O monarchs over the peoples,<br>honor wisdom, so that you may reign forever.<br>I will tell you what wisdom is and how she came to be,<br>and I will hide no secrets from you,<br>but I will trace her course from the beginning of creation,<br>and make knowledge of her clear,<br>and I will not pass by the truth;<br>nor will I travel in the company of sickly envy,<br>for envy does not associate with wisdom.</p> </div>

 <h3>Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After Jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.  A centurion there had a slave whom he valued highly, and who was ill and close to death.  When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and heal his slave.  When they came to Jesus, they appealed to him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy of having you do this for him,  for he loves our people, and it is he who built our synagogue for us.”  And Jesus went with them, but when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof;  therefore I did not presume to come to you. But only speak the word, and let my servant be healed.  For I also am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and the slave does it.”  When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”  When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.</p> <h3>Jesus Raises the Widow’s Son at Nain</h3>
<p>Soon afterwards he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.  As he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow; and with her was a large crowd from the town.  When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep.”  Then he came forward and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, rise!”  The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.  Fear seized all of them; and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has risen among us!” and “God has looked favorably on his people!”  This word about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.</p>
