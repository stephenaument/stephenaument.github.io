<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>
</div>

 <h3>The Fiery Furnace</h3>
<p>Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary,  and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.  So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire.  Because the king’s command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.</p> <h3>The Prayer of Azariah in the Furnace</h3>
<p>They walked around in the midst of the flames, singing hymns to God and blessing the Lord.  Then Azariah stood still in the fire and prayed aloud:</p> <div class="poetry">
<p class="line">“Blessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and worthy of praise;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and glorious is your name forever!</span><br>For you are just in all you have done;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>all your works are true and your ways right,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and all your judgments are true.</span><br>You have executed true judgments in all you have brought upon us<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our ancestors;</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>by a true judgment you have brought all this upon us because of our sins.</span><br>For we have sinned and broken your law in turning away from you;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in all matters we have sinned grievously.</span><br>We have not obeyed your commandments,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>we have not kept them or done what you have commanded us for our own good.</span></p> </div>

 <h3>The Temptation of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,  where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over, he was famished.  The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become a loaf of bread.”  Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘One does not live by bread alone.’”</p> <p>Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.  And the devil said to him, “To you I will give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it to anyone I please.  If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”  Jesus answered him, “It is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Worship the Lord your God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and serve only him.’”</span></p></div> <p>Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,  for it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘He will command his angels concerning you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>to protect you,’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">and</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘On their hands they will bear you up,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”  When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune time.</p>
