<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Blood of the Covenant</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then he said to Moses, “Come up to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, you and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship at a distance.  Moses alone shall come near the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.”</p> <p>Moses came and told the people all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, “All the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do.”  And Moses wrote down all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. He rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and set up twelve pillars, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel.  He sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed oxen as offerings of well-being to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he dashed against the altar.  Then he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, “All that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”  Moses took the blood and dashed it on the people, and said, “See the blood of the covenant that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has made with you in accordance with all these words.”</p> <h3>On the Mountain with God</h3>
<p>Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up,  and they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there was something like a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.  God did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; also they beheld God, and they ate and drank.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and wait there; and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.”  So Moses set out with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God.  To the elders he had said, “Wait here for us, until we come to you again; for Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a dispute may go to them.”</p> <p>Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.  The glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the cloud.  Now the appearance of the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel.  Moses entered the cloud, and went up on the mountain. Moses was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.</p>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth,  because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</p> <p>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, in truth and love.</p> <h3>Truth and Love</h3>
<p>I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.  But now, dear lady, I ask you, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning, let us love one another.  And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment just as you have heard it from the beginning—you must walk in it.</p> <p>Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh; any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist!  Be on your guard, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward.  Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ, but goes beyond it, does not have God; whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.  Do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching;  for to welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person.</p> <h3>Final Greetings</h3>
<p>Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink; instead I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p> <p>The children of your elect sister send you their greetings.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>

<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>

 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>

<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.

<p class="poetry">
  
  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
