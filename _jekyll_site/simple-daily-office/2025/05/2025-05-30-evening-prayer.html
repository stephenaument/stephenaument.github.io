<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jesus the Great High Priest</h3>
<p>Since, then, we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.  For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin.  Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p> <p class="chapter-1">Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.  He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is subject to weakness;  and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people.  And one does not presume to take this honor, but takes it only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p> <p>So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are my Son,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>today I have begotten you”;</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">as he says also in another place,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are a priest forever,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>according to the order of Melchizedek.”</span></p></div>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>17. The Song of Simeon <em class="latin_name">Nunc Dimittis</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *</p> <p class"indent">to go in peace as you have promised;</p> <p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *</p> <p class"indent">whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</p> <p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *</p> <p class"indent">and the glory of your people Israel.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class"indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>
 <p class="indent">creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>
 <p class="indent">He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
 <p class="indent2">and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
 <p class="indent2">was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
 <p class="indent">He descended to the dead.</p>
 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>
 <p class="indent">the forgiveness of sins,</p>
 <p class="indent">the resurrection of the body,</p>

in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>

be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
