<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joshua Renews the Covenant</h3>
<p>Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel,  just as Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, “an altar of unhewn stones, on which no iron tool has been used”; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and sacrificed offerings of well-being.  And there, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.  All Israel, alien as well as citizen, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark in front of the levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.  And afterward he read all the words of the law, blessings and curses, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the aliens who resided among them.</p>

 <p>But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. Then they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.  But when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.</p> <h3>The Return to Antioch in Syria</h3>
<p>After they had proclaimed the good news to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, then on to Iconium and Antioch.  There they strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith, saying, “It is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of God.”  And after they had appointed elders for them in each church, with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had come to believe.</p> <p>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.  When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.  From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed.  When they arrived, they called the church together and related all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.  And they stayed there with the disciples for some time.</p>

<p><p>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our<br>necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have<br>compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those<br>things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our<br>blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son<br>Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
