<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joshua Exhorts the People</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">A long time afterward, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had given rest to Israel from all their enemies all around, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,  Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders and heads, their judges and officers, and said to them, “I am now old and well advanced in years;  and you have seen all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God who has fought for you.  I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will push them back before you, and drive them out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God promised you.  Therefore be very steadfast to observe and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right nor to the left,  so that you may not be mixed with these nations left here among you, or make mention of the names of their gods, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow yourselves down to them,  but hold fast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, as you have done to this day.  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, no one has been able to withstand you to this day.  One of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God who fights for you, as he promised you.  Be very careful, therefore, to love the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.  For if you turn back, and join the survivors of these nations left here among you, and intermarry with them, so that you marry their women and they yours,  know assuredly that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God will not continue to drive out these nations before you; but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a scourge on your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given you.</p> <p>“And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one thing has failed of all the good things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God promised concerning you; all have come to pass for you, not one of them has failed.  But just as all the good things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will bring upon you all the bad things, until he has destroyed you from this good land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given you.  If you transgress the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, which he enjoined on you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land that he has given to you.”</p>

 <h3>The Council’s Letter to Gentile Believers</h3>
<p>Then the apostles and the elders, with the consent of the whole church, decided to choose men from among their members and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders among the brothers,  with the following letter: “The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the believers of Gentile origin in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings.  Since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us, though with no instructions from us, have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds,  we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,  who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.  We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.  For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials:  that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.”</p> <p>So they were sent off and went down to Antioch. When they gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.  When its members read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation.  Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.  After they had been there for some time, they were sent off in peace by the believers to those who had sent them.  But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, and there, with many others, they taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord.</p>

<p><p>Almighty God, the fountain of all wisdom, you know our<br>necessities before we ask and our ignorance in asking: Have<br>compassion on our weakness, and mercifully give us those<br>things which for our unworthiness we dare not, and for our<br>blindness we cannot ask; through the worthiness of your Son<br>Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.
</p>


<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.
