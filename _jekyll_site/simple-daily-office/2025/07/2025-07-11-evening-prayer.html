<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel: “Be strong and bold, for you are the one who will go with this people into the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sworn to their ancestors to give them; and you will put them in possession of it.  It is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not fail you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”</p> <h3>The Law to Be Read Every Seventh Year</h3>
<p>Then Moses wrote down this law, and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and to all the elders of Israel.  Moses commanded them: “Every seventh year, in the scheduled year of remission, during the festival of booths,  when all Israel comes to appear before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.  Assemble the people—men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing in your towns—so that they may hear and learn to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God and to observe diligently all the words of this law,  and so that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, as long as you live in the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.”</p>

 <p>When Moses had finished writing down in a book the words of this law to the very end,  Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying,  “Take this book of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; let it remain there as a witness against you.  For I know well how rebellious and stubborn you are. If you already have been so rebellious toward the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> while I am still alive among you, how much more after my death!  Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may recite these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them.

 <h3>Gentiles Hear the Good News</h3>
<p>Then Peter began to speak to them: “I truly understand that God shows no partiality,  but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.  You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all.  That message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John announced:  how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.  We are witnesses to all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;  but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear,  not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.  He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead.  All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”</p> <h3>Gentiles Receive the Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.  The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles,  for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter said,  “Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”  So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him to stay for several days.</p>
