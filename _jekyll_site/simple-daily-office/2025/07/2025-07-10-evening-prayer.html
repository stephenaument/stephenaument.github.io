<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>At that time, I charged you as follows: “Although the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has given you this land to occupy, all your troops shall cross over armed as the vanguard of your Israelite kin.  Only your wives, your children, and your livestock—I know that you have much livestock—shall stay behind in the towns that I have given to you.  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives rest to your kindred, as to you, and they too have occupied the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving them beyond the Jordan, then each of you may return to the property that I have given to you.”  And I charged Joshua as well at that time, saying: “Your own eyes have seen everything that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has done to these two kings; so the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.  Do not fear them, for it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God who fights for you.”</p> <h3>Moses Views Canaan from Pisgah</h3>
<p>At that time, too, I entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying:  “O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your might; what god in heaven or on earth can perform deeds and mighty acts like yours!  Let me cross over to see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and the Lebanon.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with me on your account and would not heed me. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Enough from you! Never speak to me of this matter again!  Go up to the top of Pisgah and look around you to the west, to the north, to the south, and to the east. Look well, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.  But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, because it is he who shall cross over at the head of this people and who shall secure their possession of the land that you will see.”  </p>

 <p>Now while Peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen, suddenly the men sent by Cornelius appeared. They were asking for Simon’s house and were standing by the gate.  They called out to ask whether Simon, who was called Peter, was staying there.  While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look, three men are searching for you.  Now get up, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them.”  So Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?”  They answered, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.”  So Peter invited them in and gave them lodging.</p>
<p>The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the believers from Joppa accompanied him.  The following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.  On Peter’s arrival Cornelius met him, and falling at his feet, worshiped him.  But Peter made him get up, saying, “Stand up; I am only a mortal.”  And as he talked with him, he went in and found that many had assembled;  and he said to them, “You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call anyone profane or unclean.  So when I was sent for, I came without objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?”</p> <p>Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, at three o’clock, I was praying in my house when suddenly a man in dazzling clothes stood before me.  He said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.  Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon, who is called Peter; he is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’  Therefore I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. So now all of us are here in the presence of God to listen to all that the Lord has commanded you to say.”</p>
