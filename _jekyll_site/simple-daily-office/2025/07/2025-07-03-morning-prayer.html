<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>The Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude; they came up and encamped at Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.  When the Israelites saw that they were in distress (for the troops were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns.  Some Hebrews crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p> <p>He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people began to slip away from Saul.  So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the offerings of well-being.” And he offered the burnt offering.  As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived; and Saul went out to meet him and salute him.  Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul replied, “When I saw that the people were slipping away from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines were mustering at Michmash,  I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’; so I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering.”  Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, which he commanded you. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> would have established your kingdom over Israel forever,  but now your kingdom will not continue; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sought out a man after his own heart; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has appointed him to be ruler over his people, because you have not kept what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded you.”  And Samuel left and went on his way from Gilgal. The rest of the people followed Saul to join the army; they went up from Gilgal toward Gibeah of Benjamin.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Battle</h3>
<p>Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.  Saul, his son Jonathan, and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped at Michmash.  And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies; one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual,  another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the mountain that looks down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people,  and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him.  Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.  I will therefore have him flogged and release him.”</p> <p>Then they all shouted out together, “Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!”  (This was a man who had been put in prison for an insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.)  Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;  but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”  A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him.”  But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed.  So Pilate gave his verdict that their demand should be granted.  He released the man they asked for, the one who had been put in prison for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over as they wished.</p>
