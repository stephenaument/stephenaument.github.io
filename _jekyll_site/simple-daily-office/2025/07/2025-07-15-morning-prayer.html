<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jonathan Intercedes for David</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Saul spoke with his son Jonathan and with all his servants about killing David. But Saul’s son Jonathan took great delight in David.  Jonathan told David, “My father Saul is trying to kill you; therefore be on guard tomorrow morning; stay in a secret place and hide yourself.  I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you; if I learn anything I will tell you.”  Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul, saying to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been of good service to you;  for he took his life in his hand when he attacked the Philistine, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced; why then will you sin against an innocent person by killing David without cause?”  Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan; Saul swore, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, he shall not be put to death.”  So Jonathan called David and related all these things to him. Jonathan then brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.</p> <h3>Michal Helps David Escape from Saul</h3>
<p>Again there was war, and David went out to fight the Philistines. He launched a heavy attack on them, so that they fled before him.  Then an evil spirit from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing music.  Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. David fled and escaped that night.</p> <p>Saul sent messengers to David’s house to keep watch over him, planning to kill him in the morning. David’s wife Michal told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”  So Michal let David down through the window; he fled away and escaped.  Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed; she put a net of goats’ hair on its head, and covered it with the clothes.  When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”  Then Saul sent the messengers to see David for themselves. He said, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”  When the messengers came in, the idol was in the bed, with the covering of goats’ hair on its head.  Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go; why should I kill you?’”</p> <h3>David Joins Samuel in Ramah</h3>
<p>Now David fled and escaped; he came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and settled at Naioth.  </p>

 <h3>Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.  So many gathered around that there was no longer room for them, not even in front of the door; and he was speaking the word to them.  Then some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.  And when they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and after having dug through it, they let down the mat on which the paralytic lay.  When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”  Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,  “Why does this fellow speak in this way? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”  At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them, “Why do you raise such questions in your hearts?  Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and take your mat and walk’?  But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—  “I say to you, stand up, take your mat and go to your home.”  And he stood up, and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</p>
