<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Anointed as King</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”  Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’  Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.”  Samuel did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”  He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</p> <p>When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed is now before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> looks on the heart.”  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has not chosen any of these.”  Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”  He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.”  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.</p>

 <h3>The Walk to Emmaus</h3>
<p>Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,  and talking with each other about all these things that had happened.  While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them,  but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.  And he said to them, “What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad.  Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?”  He asked them, “What things?” They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,  and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.  But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place.  Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,  and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.  Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.”  Then he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared!  Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?”  Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.</p> <p>As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on.  But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.” So he went in to stay with them.  When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.  Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.  They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?”  That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together.  They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!”  Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
