<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,  they on their part acted with cunning: they went and prepared provisions, and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,  with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their provisions were dry and moldy.  They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the Israelites, “We have come from a far country; so now make a treaty with us.”  But the Israelites said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a treaty with you?”  They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you? And where do you come from?”  They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country, because of the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; for we have heard a report of him, of all that he did in Egypt,  and of all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, King Sihon of Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth.  So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey; go to meet them, and say to them, “We are your servants; come now, make a treaty with us.”’  Here is our bread; it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey, on the day we set out to come to you, but now, see, it is dry and moldy;  these wineskins were new when we filled them, and see, they are burst; and these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey.”  So the leaders partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And Joshua made peace with them, guaranteeing their lives by a treaty; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.</p> <p>But when three days had passed after they had made a treaty with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and were living among them.  So the Israelites set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.  But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.  But all the leaders said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, and now we must not touch them.  This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath may not come upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them.”  The leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had decided concerning them.</p>

 <h3>The Council at Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then certain individuals came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”  And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to discuss this question with the apostles and the elders.  So they were sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, they reported the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the believers.  When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.  But some believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and said, “It is necessary for them to be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses.”</p> <p>The apostles and the elders met together to consider this matter.  After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “My brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that I should be the one through whom the Gentiles would hear the message of the good news and become believers.  And God, who knows the human heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;  and in cleansing their hearts by faith he has made no distinction between them and us.  Now therefore why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?  On the contrary, we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.”</p>
