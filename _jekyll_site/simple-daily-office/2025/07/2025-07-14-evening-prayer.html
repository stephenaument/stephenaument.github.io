<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Spies Sent to Jericho</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Joshua son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and spent the night there.  The king of Jericho was told, “Some Israelites have come here tonight to search out the land.”  Then the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come only to search out the whole land.”  But the woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.  And when it was time to close the gate at dark, the men went out. Where the men went I do not know. Pursue them quickly, for you can overtake them.”  She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax that she had laid out on the roof.  So the men pursued them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords. As soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</p> <p>Before they went to sleep, she came up to them on the roof  and said to the men: “I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt in fear before you.  For we have heard how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.  As soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any of us because of you. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth below.  Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, swear to me by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that you in turn will deal kindly with my family. Give me a sign of good faith  that you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”  The men said to her, “Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives us the land.”</p>

 <h3>The Church in Antioch</h3>
<p>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, and they spoke the word to no one except Jews.  But among them were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.  The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number became believers and turned to the Lord.  News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast devotion;  for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were brought to the Lord.  Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,  and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for an entire year they met with the church and taught a great many people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called “Christians.”</p> <p>At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.  One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign of Claudius.  The disciples determined that according to their ability, each would send relief to the believers living in Judea;  this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</p>
