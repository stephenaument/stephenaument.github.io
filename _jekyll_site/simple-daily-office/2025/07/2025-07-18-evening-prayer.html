<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.  Those twelve stones, which they had taken out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal,  saying to the Israelites, “When your children ask their parents in time to come, ‘What do these stones mean?’  then you shall let your children know, ‘Israel crossed over the Jordan here on dry ground.’  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you crossed over, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we crossed over,  so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is mighty, and so that you may fear the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God forever.”</p> <h3>The New Generation Circumcised</h3>

 <h3>The Passover at Gilgal</h3>
<p>While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal they kept the passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho.  On the day after the passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.  The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.</p> <h3>Joshua’s Vision</h3>
<p>Once when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you one of us, or one of our adversaries?”  He replied, “Neither; but as commander of the army of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> I have now come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and he said to him, “What do you command your servant, my lord?”  The commander of the army of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Joshua, “Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so.</p>

 <h3>Paul and Barnabas in Antioch of Pisidia</h3>
<p>Then Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem;  but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.  After the reading of the law and the prophets, the officials of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, give it.”  So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak:</p>
<p>“You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen.  The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.  For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.  After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance  for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.  Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.  When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’  Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised;  before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.  And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.’</p>
