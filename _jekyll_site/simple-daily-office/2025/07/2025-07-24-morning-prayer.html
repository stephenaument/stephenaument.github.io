<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Saul Consults a Medium</h3>
<p>Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. Saul had expelled the mediums and the wizards from the land.  The Philistines assembled, and came and encamped at Shunem. Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.  When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.  When Saul inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did not answer him, not by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.  Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “There is a medium at Endor.”</p> <p>So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went there, he and two men with him. They came to the woman by night. And he said, “Consult a spirit for me, and bring up for me the one whom I name to you.”  The woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the wizards from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?”  But Saul swore to her by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”  Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He answered, “Bring up Samuel for me.”  When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice; and the woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”  The king said to her, “Have no fear; what do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a divine being coming up out of the ground.”  He said to her, “What is his appearance?” She said, “An old man is coming up; he is wrapped in a robe.” So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</p> <p>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have summoned you to tell me what I should do.”  Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has turned from you and become your enemy?  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has done to you just as he spoke by me; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, David.  Because you did not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has done this thing to you today.  Moreover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”</p> <p>Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.  </p>

 <h3>Jesus Heals the Gerasene Demoniac</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.  And when he had stepped out of the boat, immediately a man out of the tombs with an unclean spirit met him.  He lived among the tombs; and no one could restrain him any more, even with a chain;  for he had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.  Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always howling and bruising himself with stones.  When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him;  and he shouted at the top of his voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.”  For he had said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”  Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “My name is Legion; for we are many.”  He begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.  Now there on the hillside a great herd of swine was feeding;  and the unclean spirits begged him, “Send us into the swine; let us enter them.”  So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.</p> <p>The swineherds ran off and told it in the city and in the country. Then people came to see what it was that had happened.  They came to Jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.  Those who had seen what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine reported it.  Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their neighborhood.  As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.  But Jesus refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you.”  And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.</p>
