<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, “God has given him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.”  Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.  When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to the priest Abiathar, “Bring the ephod here.”  David said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, your servant has heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.  And now, will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant.” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “He will come down.”  Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “They will surrender you.”  Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, set out and left Keilah; they wandered wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.  David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did not give him into his hand.</p> <h3>David Eludes Saul in the Wilderness</h3>
<p>David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh when he learned that Saul had come out to seek his life.  Saul’s son Jonathan set out and came to David at Horesh; there he strengthened his hand through the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  He said to him, “Do not be afraid; for the hand of my father Saul shall not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you; my father Saul also knows that this is so.”  Then the two of them made a covenant before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Talents</h3>
<p>“For it is as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them;  to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away.  The one who had received the five talents went off at once and traded with them, and made five more talents.  In the same way, the one who had the two talents made two more talents.  But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money.  After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.  Then the one who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; see, I have made five more talents.’  His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’  And the one with the two talents also came forward, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more talents.’  His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.’  Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed;  so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’  But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter?  Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest.  So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents.  For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.  As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</p>
