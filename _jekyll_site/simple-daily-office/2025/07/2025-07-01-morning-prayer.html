<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Saul Defeats the Ammonites</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.”  But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone’s right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.”  The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days’ respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you.”  When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported the matter in the hearing of the people; and all the people wept aloud.</p> <p>Now Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen; and Saul said, “What is the matter with the people, that they are weeping?” So they told him the message from the inhabitants of Jabesh.  And the spirit of God came upon Saul in power when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.  He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!” Then the dread of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> fell upon the people, and they came out as one.  When he mustered them at Bezek, those from Israel were three hundred thousand, and those from Judah seventy thousand.  They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus shall you say to the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.’” When the messengers came and told the inhabitants of Jabesh, they rejoiced.  So the inhabitants of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.”  The next day Saul put the people in three companies. At the morning watch they came into the camp and cut down the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</p> <p>The people said to Samuel, “Who is it that said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Give them to us so that we may put them to death.”  But Saul said, “No one shall be put to death this day, for today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has brought deliverance to Israel.”</p> <p>Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.”  So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Gilgal. There they sacrificed offerings of well-being before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and there Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly.</p>

 <h3>The Mocking and Beating of Jesus</h3>
<p>Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him;  they also blindfolded him and kept asking him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”  They kept heaping many other insults on him.</p> <h3>Jesus before the Council</h3>
<p>When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council.  They said, “If you are the Messiah, tell us.” He replied, “If I tell you, you will not believe;  and if I question you, you will not answer.  But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”  All of them asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say that I am.”  Then they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”</p>
