<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to serve other gods;  for it is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight. He protected us along all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed;  and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he is our God.”</p> <p>But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.  If you forsake the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.”  And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>!”  Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to serve him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”  He said, “Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.”  The people said to Joshua, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God we will serve, and him we will obey.”  So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.  Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Joshua said to all the people, “See, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, if you deal falsely with your God.”  So Joshua sent the people away to their inheritances.</p> <h3>Death of Joshua and Eleazar</h3>
<p>After these things Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, died, being one hundred ten years old.  They buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.</p> <p>Israel served the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did for Israel.</p> <p>The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the portion of ground that Jacob had bought from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred pieces of money; it became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.</p> <p>Eleazar son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of his son Phinehas, which had been given him in the hill country of Ephraim.</p>

 <h3>Paul and Barnabas Separate</h3>
<p>After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Come, let us return and visit the believers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”  Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.  But Paul decided not to take with them one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work.  The disagreement became so sharp that they parted company; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.  But Paul chose Silas and set out, the believers commending him to the grace of the Lord.  He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</p> <h3>Timothy Joins Paul and Silas</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Paul went on also to Derbe and to Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.  He was well spoken of by the believers in Lystra and Iconium.  Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.  As they went from town to town, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.  So the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in numbers daily.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
