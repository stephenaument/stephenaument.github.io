<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Balaam’s First Oracle</h3>
<p>On the next day Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal; and from there he could see part of the people of Israel.  Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”  Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.  Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your burnt offerings while I go aside. Perhaps the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” And he went to a bare height.</p> <p>Then God met Balaam; and Balaam said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars, and have offered a bull and a ram on each altar.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and this is what you must say.”  So he returned to Balak, who was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab.  Then Balaam uttered his oracle, saying:</p>

I brought you to curse my enemies, but now you have done nothing but bless them.”  He answered, “Must I not take care to say what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> puts into my mouth?”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <p>Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.  The two went down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit  (for as yet the Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus).  Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.  Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money,  saying, “Give me also this power so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”  But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God’s gift with money!  You have no part or share in this, for your heart is not right before God.  Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.  For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness.”  Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.”</p> <p>Now after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, proclaiming the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
