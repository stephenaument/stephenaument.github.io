<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Saul Defeats the Amalekites but Spares Their King</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Samuel said to Saul, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did in opposing the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.  Now go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”</p>

<p> Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.  He took King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the cattle and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was valuable, and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless they utterly destroyed.</p> <h3>Saul Rejected as King</h3>
<p>The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Samuel:  “I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not carried out my commands.” Samuel was angry; and he cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> all night.  Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, and Samuel was told, “Saul went to Carmel, where he set up a monument for himself, and on returning he passed on down to Gilgal.”  When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “May you be blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; I have carried out the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of cattle that I hear?”  Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the cattle, to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed.”  Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! I will tell you what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me last night.” He replied, “Speak.”</p> <p>Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> anointed you king over Israel.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go, utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’  Why then did you not obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>? Why did you swoop down on the spoil, and do what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?”  Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I have gone on the mission on which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent me, I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  But from the spoil the people took sheep and cattle, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God in Gilgal.”  And Samuel said,</p>

 <h3>The Death of Jesus</h3>
<p>It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,  while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.  Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” Having said this, he breathed his last.  When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, “Certainly this man was innocent.”  And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts.  But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</p> <h3>The Burial of Jesus</h3>
<p>Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council,  had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God.  This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid.  It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.  The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid.  Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.</p>
<p>On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</p>
