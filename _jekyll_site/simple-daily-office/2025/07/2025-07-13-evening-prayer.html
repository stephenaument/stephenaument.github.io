<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>God’s Commission to Joshua</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After the death of Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying,  “My servant Moses is dead. Now proceed to cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites.  Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I promised to Moses.  From the wilderness and the Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, to the Great Sea in the west shall be your territory.  No one shall be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you.  Be strong and courageous; for you shall put this people in possession of the land that I swore to their ancestors to give them.  Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to act in accordance with all the law that my servant Moses commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, so that you may be successful wherever you go.  This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to act in accordance with all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall be successful.  I hereby command you: Be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is with you wherever you go.”</p> <h3>Preparations for the Invasion</h3>
<p>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people,  “Pass through the camp, and command the people: ‘Prepare your provisions; for in three days you are to cross over the Jordan, to go in to take possession of the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God gives you to possess.’”</p> <p>To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,  “Remember the word that Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded you, saying, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is providing you a place of rest, and will give you this land.’  Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan. But all the warriors among you shall cross over armed before your kindred and shall help them,  until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gives rest to your kindred as well as to you, and they too take possession of the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving them. Then you shall return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave you beyond the Jordan to the east.”</p> <p>They answered Joshua: “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.  Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God be with you, as he was with Moses!  Whoever rebels against your orders and disobeys your words, whatever you command, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”</p>

<p> For Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</p> <h3>Salvation Is for All</h3>
<p>Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that “the person who does these things will live by them.”  But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)  “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say?</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The word is near you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on your lips and in your heart”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);  because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.  The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him.  For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</p> <p>But how are they to call on one in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in one of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone to proclaim him?  And how are they to proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”  But not all have obeyed the good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”  So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.</p>
