<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Israel Crosses the Jordan</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Early in the morning Joshua rose and set out from Shittim with all the Israelites, and they came to the Jordan. They camped there before crossing over.  At the end of three days the officers went through the camp  and commanded the people, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God being carried by the levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place. Follow it,  so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not passed this way before. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, a distance of about two thousand cubits; do not come any nearer to it.”  Then Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do wonders among you.”  To the priests Joshua said, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on in front of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went in front of the people.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that I will be with you as I was with Moses.  You are the one who shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”  Joshua then said to the Israelites, “Draw near and hear the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God.”  Joshua said, “By this you shall know that among you is the living God who without fail will drive out from before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites:  the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass before you into the Jordan.  So now select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.  When the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing from above shall be cut off; they shall stand in a single heap.”</p>

 <p>When morning came, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.  When Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he examined the guards and ordered them to be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.</p> <h3>The Death of Herod</h3>
<p>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him in a body; and after winning over Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for a reconciliation, because their country depended on the king’s country for food.  On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat on the platform, and delivered a public address to them.  The people kept shouting, “The voice of a god, and not of a mortal!”  And immediately, because he had not given the glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.</p> <p>But the word of God continued to advance and gain adherents.  Then after completing their mission Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem and brought with them John, whose other name was Mark.</p>
