<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>

and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

 <h3>David Spares Saul’s Life</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”  Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to look for David and his men in the direction of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.  He came to the sheepfolds beside the road, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.  The men of David said to him, “Here is the day of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.’” Then David went and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul’s cloak.  Afterward David was stricken to the heart because he had cut off a corner of Saul’s cloak.  He said to his men, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed, to raise my hand against him; for he is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed.”  So David scolded his men severely and did not permit them to attack Saul. Then Saul got up and left the cave, and went on his way.</p> <p>Afterwards David also rose up and went out of the cave and called after Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.  David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of those who say, ‘David seeks to do you harm’?  This very day your eyes have seen how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave you into my hand in the cave; and some urged me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, ‘I will not raise my hand against my lord; for he is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed.’  See, my father, see the corner of your cloak in my hand; for by the fact that I cut off the corner of your cloak, and did not kill you, you may know for certain that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you are hunting me to take my life.  May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> judge between me and you! May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be against you.  As the ancient proverb says, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you.  Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A single flea?  May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you. May he see to it, and plead my cause, and vindicate me against you.”</p> <p>When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice and wept.  He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.  Today you have explained how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put me into your hands.  For who has ever found an enemy, and sent the enemy safely away? So may the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.  Now I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.  Swear to me therefore by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not wipe out my name from my father’s house.”  So David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p>

 <h3>The Parable of the Sower</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Again he began to teach beside the sea. Such a very large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there, while the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.  He began to teach them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:  “Listen! A sower went out to sow.  And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it up.  Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly, since it had no depth of soil.  And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and since it had no root, it withered away.  Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.  Other seed fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.”  And he said, “Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”</p> <h3>The Purpose of the Parables</h3>
<p>When he was alone, those who were around him along with the twelve asked him about the parables.  And he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables;  in order that</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘they may indeed look, but not perceive,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and may indeed listen, but not understand;</span><br>so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.’”</p></div> <p>And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand all the parables?  The sower sows the word.  These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.  And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy.  But they have no root, and endure only for a while; then, when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.  And others are those sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word,  but the cares of the world, and the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it yields nothing.  And these are the ones sown on the good soil: they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.”</p>
