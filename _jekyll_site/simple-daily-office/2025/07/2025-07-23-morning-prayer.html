<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>When Abigail saw David, she hurried and alighted from the donkey, and fell before David on her face, bowing to the ground.  She fell at his feet and said, “Upon me alone, my lord, be the guilt; please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.  My lord, do not take seriously this ill-natured fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your servant, did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.</p> <p>“Now then, my lord, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has restrained you from bloodguilt and from taking vengeance with your own hand, now let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be like Nabal.  And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.  Please forgive the trespass of your servant; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.  If anyone should rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living under the care of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; but the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,  my lord shall have no cause of grief, or pangs of conscience, for having shed blood without cause or for having saved himself. And when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”</p> <p>David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today!  Blessed be your good sense, and blessed be you, who have kept me today from bloodguilt and from avenging myself by my own hand!  For as surely as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there would not have been left to Nabal so much as one male.”  Then David received from her hand what she had brought him; he said to her, “Go up to your house in peace; see, I have heeded your voice, and I have granted your petition.”</p> <p>Abigail came to Nabal; he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light.  In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him; he became like a stone.  About ten days later the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> struck Nabal, and he died.</p> <p>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who has judged the case of Nabal’s insult to me, and has kept back his servant from evil; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has returned the evildoing of Nabal upon his own head.” Then David sent and wooed Abigail, to make her his wife.  When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.”  She rose and bowed down, with her face to the ground, and said, “Your servant is a slave to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”  Abigail got up hurriedly and rode away on a donkey; her five maids attended her. She went after the messengers of David and became his wife.</p> <p>David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel; both of them became his wives.  Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from Gallim.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Stills a Storm</h3>
<p>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”  And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him.  A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped.  But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?”  He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm.  He said to them, “Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?”  And they were filled with great awe and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</p>
