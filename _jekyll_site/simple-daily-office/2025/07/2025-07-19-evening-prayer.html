<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jericho Taken and Destroyed</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the Israelites; no one came out and no one went in.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Joshua, “See, I have handed Jericho over to you, along with its king and soldiers.  You shall march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once. Thus you shall do for six days,  with seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, the priests blowing the trumpets.  When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and all the people shall charge straight ahead.”  So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  To the people he said, “Go forward and march around the city; have the armed men pass on before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>As Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> following them.  And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets; the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.  To the people Joshua gave this command: “You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, nor shall you utter a word, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”  So the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went around the city, circling it once; and they came into the camp, and spent the night in the camp.</p> <p>Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> passed on, blowing the trumpets continually. The armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, while the trumpets blew continually.  On the second day they marched around the city once and then returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</p>

<h3>Acts 13:16-43</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> So Paul stood up and with a gesture began to speak:</p>
<p>“You Israelites, and others who fear God, listen.  The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.  For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.  After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance  for about four hundred fifty years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.  Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.  When he had removed him, he made David their king. In his testimony about him he said, ‘I have found David, son of Jesse, to be a man after my heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’  Of this man’s posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised;  before his coming John had already proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.  And as John was finishing his work, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but one is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of the sandals on his feet.’</p> <p>“My brothers, you descendants of Abraham’s family, and others who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent.  Because the residents of Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize him or understand the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath, they fulfilled those words by condemning him.  Even though they found no cause for a sentence of death, they asked Pilate to have him killed.  When they had carried out everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.  But God raised him from the dead;  and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are now his witnesses to the people.  And we bring you the good news that what God promised to our ancestors  he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘You are my Son;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>today I have begotten you.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">As to his raising him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘I will give you the holy promises made to David.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore he has also said in another psalm,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘You will not let your Holy One experience corruption.’</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, died, was laid beside his ancestors, and experienced corruption;  but he whom God raised up experienced no corruption.  Let it be known to you therefore, my brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you;  by this Jesus everyone who believes is set free from all those sins from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.  Beware, therefore, that what the prophets said does not happen to you:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Look, you scoffers!<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Be amazed and perish,</span><br>for in your days I am doing a work,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a work that you will never believe, even if someone tells you.’”</span></p></div> <p>As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people urged them to speak about these things again the next sabbath.  When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</p>

<h3>15. The Song of Mary <em class="latin_name">Magnificat</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
