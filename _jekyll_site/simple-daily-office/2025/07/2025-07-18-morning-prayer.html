<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 10</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David and the Holy Bread</h3>
<p class="chapter-2"> David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”  David said to the priest Ahimelech, “The king has charged me with a matter, and said to me, ‘No one must know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.’ I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.  Now then, what have you at hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.”  The priest answered David, “I have no ordinary bread at hand, only holy bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.”  David answered the priest, “Indeed women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition; the vessels of the young men are holy even when it is a common journey; how much more today will their vessels be holy?”  So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.</p> <p>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.</p> <p>David said to Ahimelech, “Is there no spear or sword here with you? I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”  The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it, for there is none here except that one.” David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”</p> <h3>David Flees to Gath</h3>
<p>David rose and fled that day from Saul; he went to King Achish of Gath.  The servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Saul has killed his thousands,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and David his ten thousands’?”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of King Achish of Gath.  So he changed his behavior before them; he pretended to be mad when in their presence. He scratched marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle run down his beard.  Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me?  Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”</p>

  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <h3>A Multitude at the Seaside</h3>
<p>Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him;  hearing all that he was doing, they came to him in great numbers from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.  He told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush him;  for he had cured many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.  Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!”  But he sternly ordered them not to make him known.</p> <h3>Jesus Appoints the Twelve</h3>
<p>He went up the mountain and called to him those whom he wanted, and they came to him.  And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, to be with him, and to be sent out to proclaim the message,  and to have authority to cast out demons.  So he appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);  James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);  and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,  and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</p>
