<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> So Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.</p> <h3>Balaam, the Donkey, and the Angel</h3>
<p>God’s anger was kindled because he was going, and the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> took his stand in the road as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him.  The donkey saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand; so the donkey turned off the road, and went into the field; and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn it back onto the road.  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.  When the donkey saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, it scraped against the wall, and scraped Balaam’s foot against the wall; so he struck it again.  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went ahead, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.  When the donkey saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, it lay down under Balaam; and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened the mouth of the donkey, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”  Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a fool of me! I wish I had a sword in my hand! I would kill you right now!”  But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I been in the habit of treating you this way?” And he said, “No.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> standing in the road, with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed down, falling on his face.  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.  The donkey saw me, and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let it live.”  Then Balaam said to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now therefore, if it is displeasing to you, I will return home.”  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but speak only what I tell you to speak.” So Balaam went on with the officials of Balak.</p> <p>When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at Ir-moab, on the boundary formed by the Arnon, at the farthest point of the boundary.  Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?”  Balaam said to Balak, “I have come to you now, but do I have power to say just anything? The word God puts in my mouth, that is what I must say.”  </p>

<p> And Saul approved of their killing him.</p>
<h3>Saul Persecutes the Church</h3>
<p>That day a severe persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.  Devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him.  But Saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house; dragging off both men and women, he committed them to prison.</p> <h3>Philip Preaches in Samaria</h3>
<p>Now those who were scattered went from place to place, proclaiming the word.  Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah to them.  The crowds with one accord listened eagerly to what was said by Philip, hearing and seeing the signs that he did,  for unclean spirits, crying with loud shrieks, came out of many who were possessed; and many others who were paralyzed or lame were cured.  So there was great joy in that city.</p> <p>Now a certain man named Simon had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he was someone great.  All of them, from the least to the greatest, listened to him eagerly, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called Great.”  And they listened eagerly to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.  But when they believed Philip, who was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  Even Simon himself believed. After being baptized, he stayed constantly with Philip and was amazed when he saw the signs and great miracles that took place.</p>
