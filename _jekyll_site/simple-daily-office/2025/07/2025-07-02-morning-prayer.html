<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samuel’s Farewell Address</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to you in all that you have said to me, and have set a king over you.  See, it is the king who leads you now; I am old and gray, but my sons are with you. I have led you from my youth until this day.  Here I am; testify against me before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you.”  They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from the hand of anyone.”  He said to them, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.”</p> <p>Samuel said to the people, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt.  </p>

 <h3>Jesus before Pilate</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then the assembly rose as a body and brought Jesus before Pilate.  They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king.”   Then Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He answered, “You say so.”  Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for an accusation against this man.”  But they were insistent and said, “He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place.”</p> <h3>Jesus before Herod</h3>
<p>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.  And when he learned that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.  When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign.  He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer.  The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.  Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate.  That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.</p>
