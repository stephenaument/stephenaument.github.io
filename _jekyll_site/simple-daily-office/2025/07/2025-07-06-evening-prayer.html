<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joshua Appointed Moses’ Successor</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go up this mountain of the Abarim range, and see the land that I have given to the Israelites.  When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,  because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin when the congregation quarreled with me. You did not show my holiness before their eyes at the waters.” (These are the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)  Moses spoke to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying,  “Let the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint someone over the congregation  who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> may not be like sheep without a shepherd.”  So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand upon him;  have him stand before Eleazar the priest and all the congregation, and commission him in their sight.  You shall give him some of your authority, so that all the congregation of the Israelites may obey.  But he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the decision of the Urim before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; at his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the Israelites with him, the whole congregation.”  So Moses did as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation;  he laid his hands on him and commissioned him—as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had directed through Moses.</p>

 <h3>Results of Justification</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore, since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,  through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God.  And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,  and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,  and hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.</p> <p>For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.  Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die.  But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us.  Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.  For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life.  But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</p>
