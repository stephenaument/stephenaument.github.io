<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Mourns for Saul and Jonathan</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.  On the third day, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.  David said to him, “Where have you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”  David said to him, “How did things go? Tell me!” He answered, “The army fled from the battle, but also many of the army fell and died; and Saul and his son Jonathan also died.”  Then David asked the young man who was reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?”  The young man reporting to him said, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa; and there was Saul leaning on his spear, while the chariots and the horsemen drew close to him.  When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here sir.’  And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’  He said to me, ‘Come, stand over me and kill me; for convulsions have seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’  So I stood over him, and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”</p> <p>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them; and all the men who were with him did the same.  They mourned and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and for his son Jonathan, and for the army of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.  David said to the young man who had reported to him, “Where do you come from?” He answered, “I am the son of a resident alien, an Amalekite.”  David said to him, “Were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed?”  Then David called one of the young men and said, “Come here and strike him down.” So he struck him down and he died.  David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed.’”</p>

 <h3>The Rejection of Jesus at Nazareth</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">He left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.  On the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands!  Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.  Then Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.”  And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them.  And he was amazed at their unbelief.</p>
<h3>The Mission of the Twelve</h3>
<p>Then he went about among the villages teaching.  He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.  He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;  but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.  He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.  If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.”  So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent.  They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.</p>
