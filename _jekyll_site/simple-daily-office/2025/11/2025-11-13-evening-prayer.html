<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Rejoicing in Heaven</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hallelujah!<br>Salvation and glory and power to our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for his judgments are true and just;</span><br>he has judged the great whore<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>who corrupted the earth with her fornication,</span><br>and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Once more they said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hallelujah!<br>The smoke goes up from her forever and ever.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Amen. Hallelujah!”</p></div> <p>And from the throne came a voice saying,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Praise our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>all you his servants,</span><br>and all who fear him,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>small and great.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying out,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hallelujah!<br>For the Lord our God<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the Almighty reigns.</span><br>Let us rejoice and exult<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and give him the glory,</span><br>for the marriage of the Lamb has come,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his bride has made herself ready;</span><br>to her it has been granted to be clothed<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>with fine linen, bright and pure”—</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.</p> <p>And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are true words of God.”  Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your comrades who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</p>

And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
