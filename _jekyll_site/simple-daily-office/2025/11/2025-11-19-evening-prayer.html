<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Corruption of the Priesthood</h3>
<p>A son honors his father, and servants their master. If then I am a father, where is the honor due me? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. You say, “How have we despised your name?”  By offering polluted food on my altar. And you say, “How have we polluted it?” By thinking that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s table may be despised.  When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not wrong? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not wrong? Try presenting that to your governor; will he be pleased with you or show you favor? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  And now implore the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. The fault is yours. Will he show favor to any of you? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  Oh, that someone among you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hands.  For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  But you profane it when you say that the Lord’s table is polluted, and the food for it may be despised.  “What a weariness this is,” you say, and you sniff at me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Cursed be the cheat who has a male in the flock and vows to give it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished; for I am a great King, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, and my name is reverenced among the nations.</p>

 <h3>Vision of the New Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”  And in the spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God.  It has the glory of God and a radiance like a very rare jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal.  It has a great, high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the Israelites;  on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.  And the wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p> <p>The angel who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.  The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width; and he measured the city with his rod, fifteen hundred miles; its length and width and height are equal.  He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits by human measurement, which the angel was using.  The wall is built of jasper, while the city is pure gold, clear as glass.  The foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every jewel; the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,  the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.  And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each of the gates is a single pearl, and the street of the city is pure gold, transparent as glass.</p>
