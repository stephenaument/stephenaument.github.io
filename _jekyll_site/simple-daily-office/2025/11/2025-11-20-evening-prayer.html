<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<h3>Mal 2:1-16</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-1">And now, O priests, this command is for you.  If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, then I will send the curse on you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.  I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.</p> <p>Know, then, that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may hold, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  My covenant with him was a covenant of life and well-being, which I gave him; this called for reverence, and he revered me and stood in awe of my name.  True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in integrity and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.  For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.  But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to stumble by your instruction; you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in your instruction.</p> <h3>The Covenant Profaned by Judah</h3>
<p>Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?  Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.  May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> cut off from the tents of Jacob anyone who does this—any to witness or answer, or to bring an offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.</p> <p>And this you do as well: You cover the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor at your hand.  You ask, “Why does he not?” Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was a witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.  Did not one God make her? Both flesh and spirit are his. And what does the one God desire? Godly offspring. So look to yourselves, and do not let anyone be faithless to the wife of his youth.  For I hate divorce, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, and covering one’s garment with violence, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless.</p>

 <p>I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.  And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.  The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.  Its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there.  People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.  But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p> <h3>The River of Life</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb  through the middle of the street of the city. On either side of the river is the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.  Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him;  they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.  And there will be no more night; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
