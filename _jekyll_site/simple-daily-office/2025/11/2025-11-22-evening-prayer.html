<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Mal 3:13-4:6</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>You have spoken harsh words against me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Yet you say, “How have we spoken against you?”  You have said, “It is vain to serve God. What do we profit by keeping his command or by going about as mourners before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts?  Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape.”</p> <h3>The Reward of the Faithful</h3>
<p>Then those who revered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke with one another. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> took note and listened, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who revered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and thought on his name.  They shall be mine, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, my special possession on the day when I act, and I will spare them as parents spare their children who serve them.  Then once more you shall see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.</p> <h3>The Great Day of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>
</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> See, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.  But for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.  And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts.</p> <p>Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.</p> <p>Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> comes.  He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
