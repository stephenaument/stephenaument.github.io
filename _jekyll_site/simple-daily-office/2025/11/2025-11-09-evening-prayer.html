<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Paul’s Defense before Felix</h3>
<p>When the governor motioned to him to speak, Paul replied:</p>
<p>“I cheerfully make my defense, knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation.  As you can find out, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.  They did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city.  Neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me.  But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our ancestors, believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets.  I have a hope in God—a hope that they themselves also accept—that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.  Therefore I do my best always to have a clear conscience toward God and all people.  Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices.  While I was doing this, they found me in the temple, completing the rite of purification, without any crowd or disturbance.  But there were some Jews from Asia—they ought to be here before you to make an accusation, if they have anything against me.  Or let these men here tell what crime they had found when I stood before the council,  unless it was this one sentence that I called out while standing before them, ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</p>

<p><p>O God, whose blessed Son came into the world that he might<br>destroy the works of the devil and make us children of God<br>and heirs of eternal life: Grant that, having this hope, we may<br>purify ourselves as he is pure; that, when he comes again<br>with power and great glory, we may be made like him in his<br>eternal and glorious kingdom; where he lives and reigns with<br>you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>

We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
