<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Early Victories of Judas</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then his son Judas, who was called Maccabeus, took command in his place.

When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet him, and he defeated and killed him. Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled.  Then they seized their spoils; and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and used it in battle the rest of his life.</p> <p>When Seron, the commander of the Syrian army, heard that Judas had gathered a large company, including a body of faithful soldiers who stayed with him and went out to battle,  he said, “I will make a name for myself and win honor in the kingdom. I will make war on Judas and his companions, who scorn the king’s command.”  Once again a strong army of godless men went up with him to help him, to take vengeance on the Israelites.</p> <p>When he approached the ascent of Beth-horon, Judas went out to meet him with a small company.  But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, “How can we, few as we are, fight against so great and so strong a multitude? And we are faint, for we have eaten nothing today.”  Judas replied, “It is easy for many to be hemmed in by few, for in the sight of Heaven there is no difference between saving by many or by few.  It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven.  They come against us in great insolence and lawlessness to destroy us and our wives and our children, and to despoil us;  but we fight for our lives and our laws.  He himself will crush them before us; as for you, do not be afraid of them.”</p> <p>When he finished speaking, he rushed suddenly against Seron and his army, and they were crushed before him.  They pursued them down the descent of Beth-horon to the plain; eight hundred of them fell, and the rest fled into the land of the Philistines.  </p>

 <h3>The Transfiguration</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain, by themselves.  And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.  Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.  Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!”  When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear.  But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up and do not be afraid.”  And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.</p> <p>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, “Tell no one about the vision until after the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”  And the disciples asked him, “Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”  He replied, “Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things;  but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.”  Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.</p>
