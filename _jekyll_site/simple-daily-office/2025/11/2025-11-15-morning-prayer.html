<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Mattathias and His Sons</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In those days Mattathias son of John son of Simeon, a priest of the family of Joarib, moved from Jerusalem and settled in Modein.  He had five sons, John surnamed Gaddi,  Simon called Thassi,  Judas called Maccabeus,  Eleazar called Avaran, and Jonathan called Apphus.  He saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and Jerusalem,  and said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Alas! Why was I born to see this,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the ruin of my people, the ruin of the holy city,</span><br>and to live there when it was given over to the enemy,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the sanctuary given over to aliens?</span><br>Her temple has become like a person without honor;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>her glorious vessels have been carried into exile.</span><br>Her infants have been killed in her streets,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>her youths by the sword of the foe.</span><br>What nation has not inherited her palaces<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and has not seized her spoils?</span><br>All her adornment has been taken away;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>no longer free, she has become a slave.</span><br>And see, our holy place, our beauty,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and our glory have been laid waste;</span><br>the Gentiles have profaned them.<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Why should we live any longer?”</span></p></div> <p>Then Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly.</p> <h3>Pagan Worship Refused</h3>
<p>The king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town of Modein to make them offer sacrifice.  Many from Israel came to them; and Mattathias and his sons were assembled.  Then the king’s officers spoke to Mattathias as follows: “You are a leader, honored and great in this town, and supported by sons and brothers.  Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the Gentiles and the people of Judah and those that are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the Friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.”</p> <p>But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: “Even if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him, and have chosen to obey his commandments, every one of them abandoning the religion of their ancestors,  I and my sons and my brothers will continue to live by the covenant of our ancestors.  Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances.  We will not obey the king’s words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left.”</p> <p>When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein, according to the king’s command.  When Mattathias saw it, he burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him on the altar.  At the same time he killed the king’s officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar.  Thus he burned with zeal for the law, just as Phinehas did against Zimri son of Salu.</p> <p>Then Mattathias cried out in the town with a loud voice, saying: “Let every one who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!”  Then he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the town.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and undergo great suffering at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.  And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This must never happen to you.”  But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things.”</p> <h3>The Cross and Self-Denial</h3>
<p>Then Jesus told his disciples, “If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.  For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.  For what will it profit them if they gain the whole world but forfeit their life? Or what will they give in return for their life?</p> <p>“For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay everyone for what has been done.  Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</p>
