<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was finished. Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Dedication of the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> out of the city of David, which is Zion.  All the people of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the festival in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.  And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the ark.  So they brought up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.  King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.  Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.  For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.  The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; they are there to this day.  There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses had placed there at Horeb, where the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites, when they came out of the land of Egypt.  And when the priests came out of the holy place, a cloud filled the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> filled the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Then Solomon said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.<br>I have built you an exalted house,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a place for you to dwell in forever.”</span></p></div> <h3>Solomon’s Speech</h3>
<p>Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.  He said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David, saying,  ‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any of the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.’  My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to my father David, ‘You did well to consider building a house for my name;  nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’  Now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has upheld the promise that he made; for I have risen in the place of my father David; I sit on the throne of Israel, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> promised, and have built the house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel.  There I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”</p> </div>

 <h3>The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h3>
<p>Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.  Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.”  So when he came, he went up to him at once and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.  Then they laid hands on him and arrested him.  But one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear.  Then Jesus said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit?  Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.”  All of them deserted him and fled.</p> <p>A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They caught hold of him,  but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked.</p>
