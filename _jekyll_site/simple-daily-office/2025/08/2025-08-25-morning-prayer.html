<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Now Adonijah son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.  His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, “Why have you done thus and so?” He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom.  He conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with the priest Abiathar, and they supported Adonijah.  But the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the prophet Nathan, and Shimei, and Rei, and David’s own warriors did not side with Adonijah.</p> <p>Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle by the stone Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,  but he did not invite the prophet Nathan or Benaiah or the warriors or his brother Solomon.</p> <p>Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king and our lord David does not know it?  Now therefore come, let me give you advice, so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.  Go in at once to King David, and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then is Adonijah king?’  Then while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”</p> <p>So Bathsheba went to the king in his room. The king was very old; Abishag the Shunammite was attending the king.  Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, “What do you wish?”  She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, saying: Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne.  But now suddenly Adonijah has become king, though you, my lord the king, do not know it.  He has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the children of the king, the priest Abiathar, and Joab the commander of the army; but your servant Solomon he has not invited.  But you, my lord the king—the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.  Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his ancestors, that my son Solomon and I will be counted offenders.”</p> <p>While she was still speaking with the king, the prophet Nathan came in.  The king was told, “Here is the prophet Nathan.” When he came in before the king, he did obeisance to the king, with his face to the ground.  Nathan said, “My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne’?  For today he has gone down and has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s children, Joab the commander of the army, and the priest Abiathar, who are now eating and drinking before him, and saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’  But he did not invite me, your servant, and the priest Zadok, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.  Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not let your servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”</p> <h3>The Accession of Solomon</h3>
<p>King David answered, “Summon Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.  The king swore, saying, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, who has saved my life from every adversity,  as I swore to you by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘Your son Solomon shall succeed me as king, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ so will I do this day.”  Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”</p>

 <h3>The Desolating Sacrilege</h3>
<p>“But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains;  the one on the housetop must not go down or enter the house to take anything away;  the one in the field must not turn back to get a coat.  Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!  Pray that it may not be in winter.  For in those days there will be suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, no, and never will be.  And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he has cut short those days.  And if anyone says to you at that time, ‘Look! Here is the Messiah!’ or ‘Look! There he is!’—do not believe it.  False messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.  But be alert; I have already told you everything.</p> <h3>The Coming of the Son of Man</h3>
<p>“But in those days, after that suffering,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">the sun will be darkened,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the moon will not give its light,</span><br>and the stars will be falling from heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then they will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory.  Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</p>
