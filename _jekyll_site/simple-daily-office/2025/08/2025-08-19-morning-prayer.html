<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak. His head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.  A man saw it, and told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”  Joab said to the man who told him, “What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”  But the man said to Joab, “Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not raise my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying: For my sake protect the young man Absalom!  On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.”  Joab said, “I will not waste time like this with you.” He took three spears in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, while he was still alive in the oak.  And ten young men, Joab’s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him, and killed him.</p> <p>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the troops.  They took Absalom, threw him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Meanwhile all the Israelites fled to their homes.  Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar that is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance”; he called the pillar by his own name. It is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.</p>

 <h3>Jesus’ Authority Is Questioned</h3>
<p>Again they came to Jerusalem. As he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him  and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do them?”  Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.  Did the baptism of John come from heaven, or was it of human origin? Answer me.”  They argued with one another, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’  But shall we say, ‘Of human origin’?”—they were afraid of the crowd, for all regarded John as truly a prophet.  So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</p> <h3>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then he began to speak to them in parables. “A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the wine press, and built a watchtower; then he leased it to tenants and went to another country.  When the season came, he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his share of the produce of the vineyard.  But they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.  And again he sent another slave to them; this one they beat over the head and insulted.  Then he sent another, and that one they killed. And so it was with many others; some they beat, and others they killed.  He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’  But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’  So they seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.  What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.  Have you not read this scripture:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘The stone that the builders rejected<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>has become the cornerstone;</span><br>this was the Lord’s doing,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and it is amazing in our eyes’?”</span></p></div> <p>When they realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to arrest him, but they feared the crowd. So they left him and went away.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
