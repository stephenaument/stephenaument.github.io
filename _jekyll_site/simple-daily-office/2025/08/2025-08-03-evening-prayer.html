<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Midianite Oppression</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them into the hand of Midian seven years.  The hand of Midian prevailed over Israel; and because of Midian the Israelites provided for themselves hiding places in the mountains, caves and strongholds.  For whenever the Israelites put in seed, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east would come up against them.  They would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the land, as far as the neighborhood of Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep or ox or donkey.  For they and their livestock would come up, and they would even bring their tents, as thick as locusts; neither they nor their camels could be counted; so they wasted the land as they came in.  Thus Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian; and the Israelites cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> for help.</p> <p>When the Israelites cried to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> on account of the Midianites,  the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent a prophet to the Israelites; and he said to them, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of slavery;  and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you, and gave you their land;  and I said to you, ‘I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God; you shall not pay reverence to the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.’ But you have not given heed to my voice.”</p> <h3>The Call of Gideon</h3>
<p>Now the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came and sat under the oak at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him and said to him, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is with you, you mighty warrior.”  Gideon answered him, “But sir, if the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian; I hereby commission you.”  He responded, “But sir, how can I deliver Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike down the Midianites, every one of them.”  Then he said to him, “If now I have found favor with you, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.  Do not depart from here until I come to you, and bring out my present, and set it before you.” And he said, “I will stay until you return.”</p> <p>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a kid, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour; the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the oak and presented them.  The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And he did so.  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> vanished from his sight.  Then Gideon perceived that it was the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and Gideon said, “Help me, Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>! For I have seen the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> face to face.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Peace be to you; do not fear, you shall not die.”  Then Gideon built an altar there to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and called it, The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</p>

 <p>We do not live to ourselves, and we do not die to ourselves.  If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord; so then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.

Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.  For it is written,</p>
