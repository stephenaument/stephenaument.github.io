<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h3>


  <h3>Psalm 12</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Help me, L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for there is no godly one left; *</p> <p class="indent">the faithful have vanished from among us.</p> <p class="space">Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *</p> <p class="indent">with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.</p> <p class="space">Oh, that the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> would cut off all smooth tongues, *</p> <p class="indent">and close the lips that utter proud boasts!</p> <p class="space">Those who say, "With our tongue will we prevail; *</p> <p class="indent">our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"</p> <p>"Because the needy are oppressed,</p> <p>and the poor cry out in misery, *</p> <p class="indent">I will rise up," says the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>,</p> <p class="indent">"and give them the help they long for."</p> <p>&nbsp;The words of the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> are pure words, *</p> <p class="indent">like silver refined from ore</p> <p class="indent">and purified seven times in the fire.</p> <p class="space">O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, watch over us *</p> <p class="indent">and save us from this generation for ever.</p> <p class="space">The wicked prowl on every side, *</p> <p class="indent">and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</p>

  </p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>How long, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>?</p> <p>will you forget me for ever? *</p> <p class="indent">how long will you hide your face from me?</p> <p>How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,</p> <p>and grief in my heart, day after day? *</p> <p class="indent">how long shall my enemy triumph over me?</p> <p class="space">Look upon me and answer me, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> my God; *</p> <p class="indent">give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</p> <p class="space">Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," *</p> <p class="indent">and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.</p> <p class="space">But I put my trust in your mercy; *</p> <p class="indent">my heart is joyful because of your saving help.</p> <p class="space">I will sing to the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for he has dealt with me richly; *</p> <p class="indent">I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.</p>

    <p>The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." *</p> <p class="indent">All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;</p> <p class="indent">there is none who does any good.</p> <p class="space">The L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> looks down from heaven upon us all, *</p> <p class="indent">to see if there is any who is wise,</p> <p class="indent">if there is one who seeks after God.</p> <p class="space">Every one has proved faithless;</p> <p>all alike have turned bad; *</p> <p class="indent">there is none who does good; no, not one.</p> <p class="space">Have they no knowledge, all those evildoers *</p> <p class="indent">who eat up my people like bread</p> <p class="indent">and do not call upon the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>?</p> <p class="space">See how they tremble with fear, *</p> <p class="indent">because God is in the company of the righteous.</p> <p class="space">Their aim is to confound the plans of the afflicted, *</p> <p class="indent">but the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> is their refuge.</p> <p>Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *</p> <p class="indent">when the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> restores the fortunes of his people,</p> <p class="indent">Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.</p>

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Since much time had been lost and sailing was now dangerous, because even the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,  saying, “Sirs, I can see that the voyage will be with danger and much heavy loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”  But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.  Since the harbor was not suitable for spending the winter, the majority was in favor of putting to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, where they could spend the winter. It was a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest.</p> <h3>The Storm at Sea</h3>
<p>When a moderate south wind began to blow, they thought they could achieve their purpose; so they weighed anchor and began to sail past Crete, close to the shore.  But soon a violent wind, called the northeaster, rushed down from Crete.  Since the ship was caught and could not be turned head-on into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven.  By running under the lee of a small island called Cauda we were scarcely able to get the ship’s boat under control.  After hoisting it up they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they would run on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and so were driven.  We were being pounded by the storm so violently that on the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard,  and on the third day with their own hands they threw the ship’s tackle overboard.  When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest raged, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.</p> <p>Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul then stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and thereby avoided this damage and loss.  I urge you now to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.  For last night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,  and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before the emperor; and indeed, God has granted safety to all those who are sailing with you.’  So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.  But we will have to run aground on some island.”</p>
