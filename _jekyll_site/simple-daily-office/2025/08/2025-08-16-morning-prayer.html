<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David’s Adversaries</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, carrying two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred bunches of raisins, one hundred of summer fruits, and one skin of wine.  The king said to Ziba, “Why have you brought these?” Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those to drink who faint in the wilderness.”  The king said, “And where is your master’s son?” Ziba said to the king, “He remains in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather’s kingdom.’”  Then the king said to Ziba, “All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.” Ziba said, “I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord the king.”</p> <h3>Shimei Curses David</h3>
<p>When King David came to Bahurim, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out whose name was Shimei son of Gera; he came out cursing.  He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; now all the people and all the warriors were on his right and on his left.  Shimei shouted while he cursed, “Out! Out! Murderer! Scoundrel!  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has avenged on all of you the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, disaster has overtaken you; for you are a man of blood.”</p> <p>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.”  But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”  David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “My own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has bidden him.  It may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will look on my distress, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will repay me with good for this cursing of me today.”  So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, throwing stones and flinging dust at him.  The king and all the people who were with him arrived weary at the Jordan; and there he refreshed himself.</p> <h3>The Counsel of Ahithophel</h3>
<p>Now Absalom and all the Israelites came to Jerusalem; Ahithophel was with him.  When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”  Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”  Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but the one whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and this people and all the Israelites have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.  Moreover, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? Just as I have served your father, so I will serve you.”</p> <p>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give us your counsel; what shall we do?”  Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, the ones he has left to look after the house; and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”  So they pitched a tent for Absalom upon the roof; and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.  Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the oracle of God; so all the counsel of Ahithophel was esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.</p>

 <h3>Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When they were approaching Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples  and said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it.  If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ just say this, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.’”  They went away and found a colt tied near a door, outside in the street. As they were untying it,  some of the bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”  They told them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it.  Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat on it.  Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields.  Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting,</p>
