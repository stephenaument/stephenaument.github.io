<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>It was told King David, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing;  and when those who bore the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.  David danced before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all his might; David was girded with a linen ephod.  So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p> <p>As the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came into the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and she despised him in her heart.</p> <p>They brought in the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and set it in its place, inside the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and offerings of well-being before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the offerings of well-being, he blessed the people in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts,  and distributed food among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people went back to their homes.</p> <p>David returned to bless his household. But Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today, uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants’ maids, as any vulgar fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!”  David said to Michal, “It was before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who chose me in place of your father and all his household, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that I have danced before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased in my own eyes; but by the maids of whom you have spoken, by them I shall be held in honor.”  And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael</h3>
<p>The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”  Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.”  Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”  When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said of him, “Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!”  Nathanael asked him, “Where did you get to know me?” Jesus answered, “I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you.”  Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”  Jesus answered, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”  And he said to him, “Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</p>
