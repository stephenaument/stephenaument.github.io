<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe</h3>
<p>While he was making this defense, Festus exclaimed, “You are out of your mind, Paul! Too much learning is driving you insane!”  But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.  Indeed the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.  King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”  Agrippa said to Paul, “Are you so quickly persuading me to become a Christian?”  Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that not only you but also all who are listening to me today might become such as I am—except for these chains.”</p> <p>Then the king got up, and with him the governor and Bernice and those who had been seated with them;  and as they were leaving, they said to one another, “This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.”  Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to the emperor.”</p> <h3>Paul Sails for Rome</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When it was decided that we were to sail for Italy, they transferred Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort, named Julius.  Embarking on a ship of Adramyttium that was about to set sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.  The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and allowed him to go to his friends to be cared for.  Putting out to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.  After we had sailed across the sea that is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.  There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board.  We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind was against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.  Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
