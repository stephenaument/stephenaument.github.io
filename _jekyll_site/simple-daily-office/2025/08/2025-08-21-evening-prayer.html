<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Job 1:1-22</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Job and His Family</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">There was once a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.  There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.  He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.  His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another’s houses in turn; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.  And when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.” This is what Job always did.</p> <h3>Attack on Job’s Character</h3>
<p>One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil.”  Then Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Does Job fear God for nothing?  Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.  But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him!” So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>Job Loses Property and Children</h3>
<p>One day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the eldest brother’s house,  a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them,  and the Sabeans fell on them and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.”  While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; I alone have escaped to tell you.”  While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three columns, made a raid on the camels and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell you.”  While he was still speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,  and suddenly a great wind came across the desert, struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p> <p>Then Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell on the ground and worshiped.  He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has taken away; blessed be the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.</p>

 <h3>Paul before Felix at Caesarea</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney, a certain Tertullus, and they reported their case against Paul to the governor.  When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, because of you we have long enjoyed peace, and reforms have been made for this people because of your foresight.  We welcome this in every way and everywhere with utmost gratitude.  But, to detain you no further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.  We have, in fact, found this man a pestilent fellow, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.  He even tried to profane the temple, and so we seized him.  By examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him concerning everything of which we accuse him.”</p> <p>The Jews also joined in the charge by asserting that all this was true.</p> <h3>Paul’s Defense before Felix</h3>
<p>When the governor motioned to him to speak, Paul replied:</p>
<p>“I cheerfully make my defense, knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation.  As you can find out, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.  They did not find me disputing with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd either in the synagogues or throughout the city.  Neither can they prove to you the charge that they now bring against me.  But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our ancestors, believing everything laid down according to the law or written in the prophets.  I have a hope in God—a hope that they themselves also accept—that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.  Therefore I do my best always to have a clear conscience toward God and all people.  Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation and to offer sacrifices.  While I was doing this, they found me in the temple, completing the rite of purification, without any crowd or disturbance.  But there were some Jews from Asia—they ought to be here before you to make an accusation, if they have anything against me.  Or let these men here tell what crime they had found when I stood before the council,  unless it was this one sentence that I called out while standing before them, ‘It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</p> <p>But Felix, who was rather well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing with the comment, “When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.”  Then he ordered the centurion to keep him in custody, but to let him have some liberty and not to prevent any of his friends from taking care of his needs.</p>
