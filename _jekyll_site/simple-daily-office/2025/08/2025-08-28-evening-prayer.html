<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>When the fourteenth night had come, as we were drifting across the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.  So they took soundings and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they took soundings again and found fifteen fathoms.  Fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.  But when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and had lowered the boat into the sea, on the pretext of putting out anchors from the bow,  Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.”  Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and set it adrift.</p> <p>Just before daybreak, Paul urged all of them to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and remaining without food, having eaten nothing.  Therefore I urge you to take some food, for it will help you survive; for none of you will lose a hair from your heads.”  After he had said this, he took bread; and giving thanks to God in the presence of all, he broke it and began to eat.  Then all of them were encouraged and took food for themselves.  (We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons in the ship.)  After they had satisfied their hunger, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.</p> <h3>The Shipwreck</h3>
<p>In the morning they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned to run the ship ashore, if they could.  So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea. At the same time they loosened the ropes that tied the steering-oars; then hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.  But striking a reef, they ran the ship aground; the bow stuck and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.  The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none might swim away and escape;  but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,  and the rest to follow, some on planks and others on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.</p>
