<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Birth of Samson</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p> <p>There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren, having borne no children.  And the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to the woman and said to her, “Although you are barren, having borne no children, you shall conceive and bear a son.  Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, or to eat anything unclean,  for you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor is to come on his head, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth. It is he who shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”  Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, most awe-inspiring; I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name;  but he said to me, ‘You shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the boy shall be a nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’”</p> <p>Then Manoah entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I pray, let the man of God whom you sent come to us again and teach us what we are to do concerning the boy who will be born.”  God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.  So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.”  Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to this woman?” And he said, “I am.”  Then Manoah said, “Now when your words come true, what is to be the boy’s rule of life; what is he to do?”  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Manoah, “Let the woman give heed to all that I said to her.  She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine. She is not to drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. She is to observe everything that I commanded her.”</p> <p>Manoah said to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Allow us to detain you, and prepare a kid for you.”  </p>

 <h3>Paul’s Journey to Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.  When we found a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail.  We came in sight of Cyprus; and leaving it on our left, we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there.  We looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.  When our days there were ended, we left and proceeded on our journey; and all of them, with wives and children, escorted us outside the city. There we knelt down on the beach and prayed  and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.</p> <p>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the believers and stayed with them for one day.  The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.  He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.  While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.  He came to us and took Paul’s belt, bound his own feet and hands with it, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”  When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.  Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”  Since he would not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, “The Lord’s will be done.”</p>
