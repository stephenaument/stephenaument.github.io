<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Migration of Dan</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking for itself a territory to live in; for until then no territory among the tribes of Israel had been allotted to them.  So the Danites sent five valiant men from the whole number of their clan, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go, explore the land.” When they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they stayed there.  While they were at Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”  He said to them, “Micah did such and such for me, and he hired me, and I have become his priest.”  Then they said to him, “Inquire of God that we may know whether the mission we are undertaking will succeed.”  The priest replied, “Go in peace. The mission you are on is under the eye of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>The five men went on, and when they came to Laish, they observed the people who were there living securely, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing on earth, and possessing wealth. Furthermore, they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with Aram.  When they came to their kinsfolk at Zorah and Eshtaol, they said to them, “What do you report?”  They said, “Come, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, but enter in and possess the land.  When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is broad—God has indeed given it into your hands—a place where there is no lack of anything on earth.”</p> <p>Six hundred men of the Danite clan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol,  and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim.  From there they passed on to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</p> <p>Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land (that is, Laish) said to their comrades, “Do you know that in these buildings there are an ephod, teraphim, and an idol of cast metal? Now therefore consider what you will do.”  So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and greeted him.  </p>

 <h3>The Plot to Kill Paul</h3>
<p>In the morning the Jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.  There were more than forty who joined in this conspiracy.  They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food until we have killed Paul.  Now then, you and the council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you, on the pretext that you want to make a more thorough examination of his case. And we are ready to do away with him before he arrives.”</p> <p>Now the son of Paul’s sister heard about the ambush; so he went and gained entrance to the barracks and told Paul.  Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to report to him.”  So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you; he has something to tell you.”  The tribune took him by the hand, drew him aside privately, and asked, “What is it that you have to report to me?”  He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly into his case.  But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him. They have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they kill him. They are ready now and are waiting for your consent.”  So the tribune dismissed the young man, ordering him, “Tell no one that you have informed me of this.”</p> <h3>Paul Sent to Felix the Governor</h3>
<p>Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get ready to leave by nine o’clock tonight for Caesarea with two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen.  Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Felix the governor.”  </p>
