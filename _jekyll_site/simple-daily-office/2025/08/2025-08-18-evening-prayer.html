<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Micah and the Levite</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">There was a man in the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.  He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and even spoke it in my hearing,—that silver is in my possession; I took it; but now I will return it to you.” And his mother said, “May my son be blessed by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>!”  Then he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, “I consecrate the silver to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> from my hand for my son, to make an idol of cast metal.”  So when he returned the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into an idol of cast metal; and it was in the house of Micah.  This man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and teraphim, and installed one of his sons, who became his priest.  In those days there was no king in Israel; all the people did what was right in their own eyes.</p> <p>Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the clan of Judah. He was a Levite residing there.  This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to live wherever he could find a place. He came to the house of Micah in the hill country of Ephraim to carry on his work.  Micah said to him, “From where do you come?” He replied, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to live wherever I can find a place.”  Then Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a set of clothes, and your living.”  The Levite agreed to stay with the man; and the young man became to him like one of his sons.  So Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.  Then Micah said, “Now I know that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will prosper me, because the Levite has become my priest.”</p>

 <h3>Paul before the Council</h3>
<p>Since he wanted to find out what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and the entire council to meet. He brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</p> <p class="chapter-2">While Paul was looking intently at the council he said, “Brothers, up to this day I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God.”  Then the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike him on the mouth.  At this Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to judge me according to the law, and yet in violation of the law you order me to be struck?”  Those standing nearby said, “Do you dare to insult God’s high priest?”  And Paul said, “I did not realize, brothers, that he was high priest; for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a leader of your people.’”</p> <p>When Paul noticed that some were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he called out in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”  When he said this, a dissension began between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.  (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, or angel, or spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge all three.)  Then a great clamor arose, and certain scribes of the Pharisees’ group stood up and contended, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”  When the dissension became violent, the tribune, fearing that they would tear Paul to pieces, ordered the soldiers to go down, take him by force, and bring him into the barracks.</p> <p>That night the Lord stood near him and said, “Keep up your courage! For just as you have testified for me in Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also in Rome.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
