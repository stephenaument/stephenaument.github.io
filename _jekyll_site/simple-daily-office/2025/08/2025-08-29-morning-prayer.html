<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 16</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Preparations and Materials for the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> Now King Hiram of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father; for Hiram had always been a friend to David.  Solomon sent word to Hiram, saying,  “You know that my father David could not build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put them under the soles of his feet.  But now the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.  So I intend to build a house for the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to my father David, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.’  Therefore command that cedars from the Lebanon be cut for me. My servants will join your servants, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants; for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”</p> <p>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> today, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.”  Hiram sent word to Solomon, “I have heard the message that you have sent to me; I will fulfill all your needs in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.  My servants shall bring it down to the sea from the Lebanon; I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will have them broken up there for you to take away. And you shall meet my needs by providing food for my household.”  So Hiram supplied Solomon’s every need for timber of cedar and cypress.  Solomon in turn gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty cors of fine oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.  So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and the two of them made a treaty.</p> <p>King Solomon conscripted forced labor out of all Israel; the levy numbered thirty thousand men.  He sent them to the Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts; they would be a month in the Lebanon and two months at home; Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.  Solomon also had seventy thousand laborers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country,  besides Solomon’s three thousand three hundred supervisors who were over the work, having charge of the people who did the work.  At the king’s command, they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.  So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did the stonecutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.</p> <h3>Solomon Builds the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  </p> <!--end of footnotes-->

  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<p> And Jesus said to them, “You will all become deserters; for it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘I will strike the shepherd,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the sheep will be scattered.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”  Peter said to him, “Even though all become deserters, I will not.”  Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this day, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.”  But he said vehemently, “Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And all of them said the same.</p> <h3>Jesus Prays in Gethsemane</h3>
<p>They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”  He took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be distressed and agitated.  And he said to them, “I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and keep awake.”  And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  He said, “Abba, Father, for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want.”  He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour?  Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.  And once more he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.  He came a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.”</p>
