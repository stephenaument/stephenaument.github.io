<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Once again the Philistines came up, and were spread out in the valley of Rephaim.  When David inquired of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he said, “You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.  When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then be on the alert; for then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”  David did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him; and he struck down the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gezer.</p> <h3>David Brings the Ark to Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.  David and all the people with him set out and went from Baale-judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts who is enthroned on the cherubim.  They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were driving the new cart  with the ark of God; and Ahio went in front of the ark.  David and all the house of Israel were dancing before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all their might, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals.</p> <p>When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen shook it.  The anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there because he reached out his hand to the ark; and he died there beside the ark of God.  David was angry because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had burst forth with an outburst upon Uzzah; so that place is called Perez-uzzah, to this day.  David was afraid of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that day; he said, “How can the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> come into my care?”  So David was unwilling to take the ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> into his care in the city of David; instead David took it to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.  The ark of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed Obed-edom and all his household.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Feeding the Four Thousand</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In those days when there was again a great crowd without anything to eat, he called his disciples and said to them,  “I have compassion for the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat.  If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way—and some of them have come from a great distance.”  His disciples replied, “How can one feed these people with bread here in the desert?”  He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”  Then he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute; and they distributed them to the crowd.  They had also a few small fish; and after blessing them, he ordered that these too should be distributed.  They ate and were filled; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.  Now there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.  And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</p>
