<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Attack on Job’s Health</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">One day the heavenly beings came to present themselves before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil. He still persists in his integrity, although you incited me against him, to destroy him for no reason.”  Then Satan answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Skin for skin! All that people have they will give to save their lives.  But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Satan, “Very well, he is in your power; only spare his life.”</p> <p>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.  Job took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.</p> <p>Then his wife said to him, “Do you still persist in your integrity? Curse God, and die.”  But he said to her, “You speak as any foolish woman would speak. Shall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not receive the bad?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</p> <h3>Job’s Three Friends</h3>
<p>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all these troubles that had come upon him, each of them set out from his home—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to go and console and comfort him.  When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him, and they raised their voices and wept aloud; they tore their robes and threw dust in the air upon their heads.  They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.</p>

 <h3>Paul Held in Custody</h3>
<p>Some days later when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him speak concerning faith in Christ Jesus.  And as he discussed justice, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for the present; when I have an opportunity, I will send for you.”  At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul, and for that reason he used to send for him very often and converse with him.</p> <p>After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and since he wanted to grant the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</p> <h3>Paul Appeals to the Emperor</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem  where the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews gave him a report against Paul. They appealed to him  and requested, as a favor to them against Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem. They were, in fact, planning an ambush to kill him along the way.  Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly.  “So,” he said, “let those of you who have the authority come down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him.”</p> <p>After he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.  When he arrived, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem surrounded him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.  Paul said in his defense, “I have in no way committed an offense against the law of the Jews, or against the temple, or against the emperor.”  But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me on these charges?”  Paul said, “I am appealing to the emperor’s tribunal; this is where I should be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.  Now if I am in the wrong and have committed something for which I deserve to die, I am not trying to escape death; but if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can turn me over to them. I appeal to the emperor.”  Then Festus, after he had conferred with his council, replied, “You have appealed to the emperor; to the emperor you will go.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
