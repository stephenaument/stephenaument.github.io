<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Abimelech Attempts to Establish a Monarchy</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s kinsfolk and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family,  “Say in the hearing of all the lords of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.”  So his mother’s kinsfolk spoke all these words on his behalf in the hearing of all the lords of Shechem; and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.”  They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the temple of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.  He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone; but Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, for he hid himself.  Then all the lords of Shechem and all Beth-millo came together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.</p> <h3>The Parable of the Trees</h3>
<p>When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and cried aloud and said to them, “Listen to me, you lords of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">The trees once went out<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>to anoint a king over themselves.</span><br>So they said to the olive tree,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘Reign over us.’</span><br>The olive tree answered them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘Shall I stop producing my rich oil</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>by which gods and mortals are honored,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and go to sway over the trees?’</span><br>Then the trees said to the fig tree,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘You come and reign over us.’</span><br>But the fig tree answered them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘Shall I stop producing my sweetness</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and my delicious fruit,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and go to sway over the trees?’</span><br>Then the trees said to the vine,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘You come and reign over us.’</span><br>But the vine said to them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘Shall I stop producing my wine</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>that cheers gods and mortals,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and go to sway over the trees?’</span><br>So all the trees said to the bramble,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘You come and reign over us.’</span><br>And the bramble said to the trees,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘If in good faith you are anointing me king over you,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>then come and take refuge in my shade;</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but if not, let fire come out of the bramble</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’</span></p></div> <p>“Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and honor when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him as his actions deserved—  </p>

 <h3>The Riot in Ephesus</h3>
<p>Now after these things had been accomplished, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia, and then to go on to Jerusalem. He said, “After I have gone there, I must also see Rome.”  So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed for some time longer in Asia.</p> <p>About that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the Way.  A man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the artisans.  These he gathered together, with the workers of the same trade, and said, “Men, you know that we get our wealth from this business.  You also see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost the whole of Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not gods.  And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be scorned, and she will be deprived of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her.”</p> <p>When they heard this, they were enraged and shouted, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”  The city was filled with the confusion; and people rushed together to the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul’s travel companions.  Paul wished to go into the crowd, but the disciples would not let him;  even some officials of the province of Asia, who were friendly to him, sent him a message urging him not to venture into the theater.  Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.  Some of the crowd gave instructions to Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward. And Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people.  But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours all of them shouted in unison, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”  But when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Citizens of Ephesus, who is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell from heaven?  Since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.  You have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.  If therefore Demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges there against one another.  If there is anything further you want to know, it must be settled in the regular assembly.  For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.”  When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</p>
