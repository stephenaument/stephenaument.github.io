<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Samson and Delilah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Once Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute and went in to her.  The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here.” So they circled around and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, thinking, “Let us wait until the light of the morning; then we will kill him.”  But Samson lay only until midnight. Then at midnight he rose up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron.</p> <p>After this he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.  The lords of the Philistines came to her and said to her, “Coax him, and find out what makes his strength so great, and how we may overpower him, so that we may bind him in order to subdue him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”  So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me what makes your strength so great, and how you could be bound, so that one could subdue you.”  Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that are not dried out, then I shall become weak, and be like anyone else.”  Then the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not dried out, and she bound him with them.  While men were lying in wait in an inner chamber, she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bowstrings, as a strand of fiber snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.</p> <p>Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and told me lies; please tell me how you could be bound.”  He said to her, “If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak, and be like anyone else.”  So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” (The men lying in wait were in an inner chamber.) But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.</p> <p>Then Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me how you could be bound.” He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and make it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak, and be like anyone else.”  So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web, and made them tight with the pin. Then she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.</p>

 <h3>Paul Sent to the Gentiles</h3>
<p>“After I had returned to Jerusalem and while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance  and saw Jesus saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’  And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.  And while the blood of your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing by, approving and keeping the coats of those who killed him.’  Then he said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”</p> <h3>Paul and the Roman Tribune</h3>
<p>Up to this point they listened to him, but then they shouted, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.”  And while they were shouting, throwing off their cloaks, and tossing dust into the air,  the tribune directed that he was to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by flogging, to find out the reason for this outcry against him.  But when they had tied him up with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who is uncondemned?”  When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen.”  The tribune came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”  The tribune answered, “It cost me a large sum of money to get my citizenship.” Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”  Immediately those who were about to examine him drew back from him; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</p>
