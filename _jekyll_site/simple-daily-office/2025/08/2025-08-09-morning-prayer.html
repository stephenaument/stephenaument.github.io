<h3 class="title">Saturday In The Week Of Proper 13</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> Then Nathan went to his house.</p>
<h3>Bathsheba’s Child Dies</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it became very ill.  David therefore pleaded with God for the child; David fasted, and went in and lay all night on the ground.  The elders of his house stood beside him, urging him to rise from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.  On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, “While the child was still alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us; how then can we tell him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.”  But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, he perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.”</p> <p>Then David rose from the ground, washed, anointed himself, and changed his clothes. He went into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and worshiped; he then went to his own house; and when he asked, they set food before him and he ate.  Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you rose and ate food.”  He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows? The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> may be gracious to me, and the child may live.’  But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”</p> <h3>Solomon Is Born</h3>
<p>Then David consoled his wife Bathsheba, and went to her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he named him Solomon. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> loved him,  and sent a message by the prophet Nathan; so he named him Jedidiah, because of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>The Ammonites Crushed</h3>
<p>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and took the royal city.  Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the water city.  Now, then, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; or I myself will take the city, and it will be called by my name.”  So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.  He took the crown of Milcom from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s head. He also brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.  He brought out the people who were in it, and set them to work with saws and iron picks and iron axes, or sent them to the brickworks. Thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Again Foretells His Death and Resurrection</h3>
<p>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know it;  for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is to be betrayed into human hands, and they will kill him, and three days after being killed, he will rise again.”  But they did not understand what he was saying and were afraid to ask him.</p> <h3>Who Is the Greatest?</h3>
<p>Then they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the way?”  But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another who was the greatest.  He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, “Whoever wants to be first must be last of all and servant of all.”  Then he took a little child and put it among them; and taking it in his arms, he said to them,  “Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”</p> <h3>Another Exorcist</h3>
<p>John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”  But Jesus said, “Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.  Whoever is not against us is for us.  For truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will by no means lose the reward.</p>
