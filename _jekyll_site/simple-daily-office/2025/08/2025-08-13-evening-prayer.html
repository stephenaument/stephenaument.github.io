<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Manoah said to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “Allow us to detain you, and prepare a kid for you.”  The angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Manoah, “If you detain me, I will not eat your food; but if you want to prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.” (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.)

 <p>After these days we got ready and started to go up to Jerusalem.  Some of the disciples from Caesarea also came along and brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.</p> <h3>Paul Visits James at Jerusalem</h3>
<p>When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us warmly.  The next day Paul went with us to visit James; and all the elders were present.  After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.  When they heard it, they praised God. Then they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the law.  They have been told about you that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.  What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.  So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow.  Join these men, go through the rite of purification with them, and pay for the shaving of their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself observe and guard the law.  But as for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.”  Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having purified himself, he entered the temple with them, making public the completion of the days of purification when the sacrifice would be made for each of them.</p>
