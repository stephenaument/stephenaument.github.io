<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="first-line-none">Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have given heed to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt.  I declare that I will bring you up out of the misery of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.’  They will listen to your voice; and you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; let us now go a three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God.’  I know, however, that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless compelled by a mighty hand.  So I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will perform in it; after that he will let you go.  I will bring this people into such favor with the Egyptians that, when you go, you will not go empty-handed;  each woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman living in the neighbor’s house for jewelry of silver and of gold, and clothing, and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters; and so you shall plunder the Egyptians.”</p> <h3>Moses’ Miraculous Power</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Moses answered, “But suppose they do not believe me or listen to me, but say, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did not appear to you.’”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A staff.”  And he said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw the staff on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses drew back from it.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Reach out your hand, and seize it by the tail”—so he reached out his hand and grasped it, and it became a staff in his hand—  “so that they may believe that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”</p> <p>Again, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” He put his hand into his cloak; and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.  Then God said, “Put your hand back into your cloak”—so he put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored like the rest of his body—  “If they will not believe you or heed the first sign, they may believe the second sign.  If they will not believe even these two signs or heed you, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water that you shall take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”</p> <p>But Moses said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “O my Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor even now that you have spoken to your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Who gives speech to mortals? Who makes them mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?  Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to speak.”  </p> <!--end of footnotes-->

  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>Rom 10:1-13</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p class="chapter-2">Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.  I can testify that they have a zeal for God, but it is not enlightened.  For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to God’s righteousness.  For Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</p> <h3>Salvation Is for All</h3>
<p>Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that “the person who does these things will live by them.”  But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)  “or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).  But what does it say?</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The word is near you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on your lips and in your heart”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">(that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);  because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.  The scripture says, “No one who believes in him will be put to shame.”  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him.  For, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</p>
