<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>The Plot to Kill Lazarus</h3>
<p>When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.  So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well,  since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus.</p> <h3>Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem</h3>
<p>The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.  So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Hosanna!<br>Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord—<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the King of Israel!”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it is written:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion.<br>Look, your king is coming,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>sitting on a donkey’s colt!”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him.  So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.  It was also because they heard that he had performed this sign that the crowd went to meet him.  The Pharisees then said to one another, “You see, you can do nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!”</p>
