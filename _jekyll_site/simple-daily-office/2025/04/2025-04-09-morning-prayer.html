<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>Jesus the Good Shepherd</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">“Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit.  The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.  The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.  They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.”  Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p> <p>So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.  All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.  I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</p> <p>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,  just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.  I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.  For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.  No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.”</p>
