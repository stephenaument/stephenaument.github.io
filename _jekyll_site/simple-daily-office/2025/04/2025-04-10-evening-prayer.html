<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Bricks without Straw</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘Let my people go, so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.’”  But Pharaoh said, “Who is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that I should heed him and let Israel go? I do not know the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and I will not let Israel go.”  Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us; let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, or he will fall upon us with pestilence or sword.”  But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Get to your labors!”  Pharaoh continued, “Now they are more numerous than the people of the land and yet you want them to stop working!”  That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, as well as their supervisors,  “You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as before; let them go and gather straw for themselves.  But you shall require of them the same quantity of bricks as they have made previously; do not diminish it, for they are lazy; that is why they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’  Let heavier work be laid on them; then they will labor at it and pay no attention to deceptive words.”</p> <p>So the taskmasters and the supervisors of the people went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw.  Go and get straw yourselves, wherever you can find it; but your work will not be lessened in the least.’”  So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.  The taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, the same daily assignment as when you were given straw.”  And the supervisors of the Israelites, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, “Why did you not finish the required quantity of bricks yesterday and today, as you did before?”</p> <p>Then the Israelite supervisors came to Pharaoh and cried, “Why do you treat your servants like this?  No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Look how your servants are beaten! You are unjust to your own people.”  He said, “You are lazy, lazy; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’  Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, but you shall still deliver the same number of bricks.”  The Israelite supervisors saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You shall not lessen your daily number of bricks.”  As they left Pharaoh, they came upon Moses and Aaron who were waiting to meet them.  They said to them, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> look upon you and judge! You have brought us into bad odor with Pharaoh and his officials, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”</p> <p>Then Moses turned again to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, why have you mistreated this people? Why did you ever send me?  Since I first came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has mistreated this people, and you have done nothing at all to deliver your people.”</p> <h3>Israel’s Deliverance Assured</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh: Indeed, by a mighty hand he will let them go; by a mighty hand he will drive them out of his land.”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Israel’s Rejection Is Not Final</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.  God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?  “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”  But what is the divine reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”  So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.  But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace.</p> <p>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,  as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“God gave them a sluggish spirit,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>eyes that would not see</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and ears that would not hear,</span><br>down to this very day.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And David says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Let their table become a snare and a trap,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</span><br>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and keep their backs forever bent.”</span></p></div> <h3>The Salvation of the Gentiles</h3>
<p>So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But through their stumbling salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.  Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their defeat means riches for Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
