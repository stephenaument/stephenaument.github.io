<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>This day shall be a day of remembrance for you. You shall celebrate it as a festival to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; throughout your generations you shall observe it as a perpetual ordinance.  Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day shall be cut off from Israel.  On the first day you shall hold a solemn assembly, and on the seventh day a solemn assembly; no work shall be done on those days; only what everyone must eat, that alone may be prepared by you.  You shall observe the festival of unleavened bread, for on this very day I brought your companies out of the land of Egypt: you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.  In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day, you shall eat unleavened bread.  For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether an alien or a native of the land.  You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall eat unleavened bread.</p> <p>Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover lamb.  Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood in the basin. None of you shall go outside the door of your house until morning.  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will pass through to strike down the Egyptians; when he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will pass over that door and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you down.  You shall observe this rite as a perpetual ordinance for you and your children.  When you come to the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this observance.  And when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this observance?’  you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, when he struck down the Egyptians but spared our houses.’” And the people bowed down and worshiped.</p>

 <p>“You that are Israelites, listen to what I have to say: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power, wonders, and signs that God did through him among you, as you yourselves know—  this man, handed over to you according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of those outside the law.  But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.  For David says concerning him,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘I saw the Lord always before me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken;</span><br>therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>moreover my flesh will live in hope.</span><br>For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or let your Holy One experience corruption.</span><br>You have made known to me the ways of life;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’</span></p></div> <p>“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.  Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.  Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,</p>
