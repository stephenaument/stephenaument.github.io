<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Festival of Unleavened Bread</h3>
<p>Moses said to the people, “Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought you out from there by strength of hand; no leavened bread shall be eaten.  Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out.  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brings you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall keep this observance in this month.  Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen in your possession, and no leaven shall be seen among you in all your territory.  You shall tell your child on that day, ‘It is because of what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did for me when I came out of Egypt.’  It shall serve for you as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the teaching of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> may be on your lips; for with a strong hand the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought you out of Egypt.  You shall keep this ordinance at its proper time from year to year.</p>

 <h3>Peter Speaks in Solomon’s Portico</h3>
<p>While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s Portico, utterly astonished.  When Peter saw it, he addressed the people, “You Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk?  The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our ancestors has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate, though he had decided to release him.  But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,  and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.  And by faith in his name, his name itself has made this man strong, whom you see and know; and the faith that is through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</p> <p>“And now, friends, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.  In this way God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, that his Messiah would suffer.  Repent therefore, and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out,  so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Messiah appointed for you, that is, Jesus,  who must remain in heaven until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through his holy prophets.  Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you from your own people a prophet like me. You must listen to whatever he tells you.  And it will be that everyone who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly rooted out of the people.’  And all the prophets, as many as have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, also predicted these days.  You are the descendants of the prophets and of the covenant that God gave to your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your descendants all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’  When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”</p>
