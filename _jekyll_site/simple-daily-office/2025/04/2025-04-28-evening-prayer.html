<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land; and the waters were divided.  The Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.  The Egyptians pursued, and went into the sea after them, all of Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and chariot drivers.  At the morning watch the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the pillar of fire and cloud looked down upon the Egyptian army, and threw the Egyptian army into panic.  He clogged their chariot wheels so that they turned with difficulty. The Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the Israelites, for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is fighting for them against Egypt.”</p> <h3>The Pursuers Drowned</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and chariot drivers.”  So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned to its normal depth. As the Egyptians fled before it, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> tossed the Egyptians into the sea.  The waters returned and covered the chariots and the chariot drivers, the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not one of them remained.  But the Israelites walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.</p> <p>Thus the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> saved Israel that day from the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  Israel saw the great work that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did against the Egyptians. So the people feared the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and believed in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and in his servant Moses.</p>

<h3>8. The Song of Moses <em class="latin_name">Cantemus Domino</em></h3>

  <p>I will sing to the Lord, for he is lofty and uplifted; *</p> <p class="indent">the horse and its rider has he hurled into the sea.</p> <p>The Lord is my strength and my refuge; *</p> <p class="indent">the Lord has become my Savior.</p> <p>This is my God and I will praise him, *</p> <p class="indent">the God of my people and I will exalt him.</p> <p>The Lord is a mighty warrior; *</p> <p class="indent">Yahweh is his Name.</p> <p>The chariots of Pharaoh and his army has he hurled into the sea; *</p> <p class="indent">the finest of those who bear armor have been drowned in the Red Sea.</p> <p>The fathomless deep has overwhelmed them; *</p> <p class="indent">they sank into the depths like a stone.</p> <p>Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in might; *</p> <p class="indent">your right hand, O Lord, has overthrown the enemy.</p> <p>Who can be compared with you, O Lord, among the gods? *</p> <p class="indent">who is like you, glorious in holiness,</p> <p class="indent">awesome in renown, and worker of wonders?</p> <p>You stretched forth your right hand; *</p> <p class="indent">the earth swallowed them up.</p> <p>With your constant love you led the people you redeemed; *</p> <p class="indent">with your might you brought them in safety to your holy dwelling.</p> <p>You will bring them in and plant them *</p> <p class="indent">on the mount of your possession,</p> <p>The resting-place you have made for yourself, O Lord, *</p> <p class="indent">the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hand has established.</p> <p>The Lord shall reign *</p> <p class="indent">for ever and for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <h3>The Word of Life</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—  this life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us—  we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.  We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.</p> <h3>God Is Light</h3>
<p>This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all.  If we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness, we lie and do not do what is true;  but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>

<p>Most holy God, the source of all good desires, all right judgments, and all just works: Give to us, your servants, that peace which the world cannot give, so that our minds may be fixed on the doing of your will, and that we, being delivered from the fear of all enemies, may live in peace and quietness; through the mercies of Christ Jesus our Savior. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
