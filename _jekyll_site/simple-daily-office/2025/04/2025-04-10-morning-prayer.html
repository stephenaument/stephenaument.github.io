<h3 class="date">April 10, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Thursday In The Week Of 5 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">1 John 1:8-9</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, but if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jeremiah’s Prophecies in the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Stand in the court of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; speak to them all the words that I command you; do not hold back a word.  It may be that they will listen, all of them, and will turn from their evil way, that I may change my mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on them because of their evil doings.  You shall say to them: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,  and to heed the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently—though you have not heeded—  then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.</p> <p>The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, “You shall die!  Why have you prophesied in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, “This man deserves the sentence of death because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”</p> <p>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, “It is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.  Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will change his mind about the disaster that he has pronounced against you.  But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.  Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”</p> <p>Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God.”  </p>

 <p>Again the Jews were divided because of these words.  Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why listen to him?”  Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”</p> <h3>Jesus Is Rejected by the Jews</h3>
<p>At that time the festival of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,  and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon.  So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”  Jesus answered, “I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name testify to me;  but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep.  My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.  I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand.  What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it out of the Father’s hand.  The Father and I are one.”</p> <p>The Jews took up stones again to stone him.  Jesus replied, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?”  The Jews answered, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you, but for blasphemy, because you, though only a human being, are making yourself God.”  Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?  If those to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’—and the scripture cannot be annulled—  can you say that the one whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?  If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me.  But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”  Then they tried to arrest him again, but he escaped from their hands.</p> <p>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he remained there.  Many came to him, and they were saying, “John performed no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.”  And many believed in him there.</p>
