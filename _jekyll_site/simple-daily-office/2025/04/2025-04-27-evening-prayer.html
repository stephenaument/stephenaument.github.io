<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the minds of Pharaoh and his officials were changed toward the people, and they said, “What have we done, letting Israel leave our service?”  So he had his chariot made ready, and took his army with him;  he took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the Israelites, who were going out boldly.  The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, his chariot drivers and his army; they overtook them camped by the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.</p> <p>As Pharaoh drew near, the Israelites looked back, and there were the Egyptians advancing on them. In great fear the Israelites cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?  Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”  But Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid, stand firm, and see the deliverance that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you shall never see again.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will fight for you, and you have only to keep still.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward.  But you lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the Israelites may go into the sea on dry ground.  Then I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and so I will gain glory for myself over Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots, and his chariot drivers.  And the Egyptians shall know that I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I have gained glory for myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his chariot drivers.”</p> <p>The angel of God who was going before the Israelite army moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and took its place behind them.  It came between the army of Egypt and the army of Israel. And so the cloud was there with the darkness, and it lit up the night; one did not come near the other all night.</p> <p>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land; and the waters were divided.  The Israelites went into the sea on dry ground, the waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.  </p>

<p> Like newborn infants, long for the pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation—  if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.</p> <p>Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and  like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.  For it stands in scripture:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“See, I am laying in Zion a stone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a cornerstone chosen and precious;</span><br>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not believe,</p>

<p class="first-line-none">They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.</p> <p>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Once you were not a people,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now you are God’s people;</span><br>once you had not received mercy,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now you have received mercy.</span></p></div>
