<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>After a long time the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out. Out of the slavery their cry for help rose up to God.  God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  God looked upon the Israelites, and God took notice of them.</p> <h3>Moses at the Burning Bush</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian; he led his flock beyond the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.  There the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to him in a flame of fire out of a bush; he looked, and the bush was blazing, yet it was not consumed.  Then Moses said, “I must turn aside and look at this great sight, and see why the bush is not burned up.”  When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”  Then he said, “Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.”  He said further, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “I have observed the misery of my people who are in Egypt; I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings,  and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the country of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.  The cry of the Israelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them.  So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”  But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”  He said, “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”</p> <h3>The Divine Name Revealed</h3>
<p>But Moses said to God, “If I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?”  God said to Moses, “I <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">am who</span> I <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">am</span>.” He said further, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘I <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">am</span> has sent me to you.’”  God also said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you’:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>God’s Wrath and Mercy</h3>
<p>You will say to me then, “Why then does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?”  But who indeed are you, a human being, to argue with God? Will what is molded say to the one who molds it, “Why have you made me like this?”  Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one object for special use and another for ordinary use?  What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath that are made for destruction;  and what if he has done so in order to make known the riches of his glory for the objects of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory—  including us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?  As indeed he says in Hosea,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”</span><br>“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there they shall be called children of the living God.”</span></p></div> <p>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, “Though the number of the children of Israel were like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved;  for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth quickly and decisively.”  And as Isaiah predicted,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“If the Lord of hosts had not left survivors to us,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>we would have fared like Sodom</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and been made like Gomorrah.”</span></p></div> <h3>Israel’s Unbelief</h3>
<p>What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;  but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.  Why not? Because they did not strive for it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,  as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“See, I am laying in Zion a stone that will make people stumble, a rock that will make them fall,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”</span></p></div>

Amen.
