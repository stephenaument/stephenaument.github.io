<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Christ our Passover</h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Alleluia.</p> <p>Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; *</p>
 <p class="indent">therefore let us keep the feast,</p>
 <p>Not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, *</p>
 <p class="indent">but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; *</p> <p class="indent">death no longer has dominion over him.</p>
 <p>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; *</p> <p class="indent">but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
 <p>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, *</p>
 <p class="indent">and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</p>
 <p class="space">Christ has been raised from the dead, *</p>
 <p class="indent">the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>For since by a man came death, *</p>
 <p class="indent">by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
 <p>For as in Adam all die, *</p>
 <p class="indent">so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</p>

 <h3>God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</h3>
<p>Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,  and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish.  Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">Daniel said:<br>“Blessed be the name of God from age to age,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for wisdom and power are his.</span><br>He changes times and seasons,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>deposes kings and sets up kings;</span><br>he gives wisdom to the wise<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and knowledge to those who have understanding.</span><br>He reveals deep and hidden things;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>he knows what is in the darkness,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and light dwells with him.</span><br>To you, O God of my ancestors,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I give thanks and praise,</span><br>for you have given me wisdom and power,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and have now revealed to me what we asked of you,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for you have revealed to us what the king ordered.”</span></p></div> <h3>Daniel Interprets the Dream</h3>
<p>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will give the king the interpretation.”</p> <p>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him: “I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can tell the king the interpretation.”  The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”  Daniel answered the king, “No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or diviners can show to the king the mystery that the king is asking,  but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has disclosed to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at the end of days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed were these:  To you, O king, as you lay in bed, came thoughts of what would be hereafter, and the revealer of mysteries disclosed to you what is to be.  But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living being, but in order that the interpretation may be known to the king and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.</p>
