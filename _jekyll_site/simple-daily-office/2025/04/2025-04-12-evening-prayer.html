<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Seven days passed after the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had struck the Nile.</p> <h3>The Second Plague: Frogs</h3>
<p class="chapter-1"> Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.  If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.  The river shall swarm with frogs; they shall come up into your palace, into your bedchamber and your bed, and into the houses of your officials and of your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.  The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your officials.’”   And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, the canals, and the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”  So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.  But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought frogs up on the land of Egypt.</p> <p>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Pray to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to take away the frogs from me and my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  Moses said to Pharaoh, “Kindly tell me when I am to pray for you and for your officials and for your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.”  And he said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “As you say! So that you may know that there is no one like the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God,  the frogs shall leave you and your houses and your officials and your people; they shall be left only in the Nile.”  Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> concerning the frogs that he had brought upon Pharaoh.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did as Moses requested: the frogs died in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.  And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.  But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to them, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</p> <h3>The Third Plague: Gnats</h3>
<p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.’”  And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and gnats came on humans and animals alike; all the dust of the earth turned into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.  The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. There were gnats on both humans and animals.  And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God!” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>All Israel Will Be Saved</h3>
<p>So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.  And so all Israel will be saved; as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Out of Zion will come the Deliverer;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.”</span><br>“And this is my covenant with them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>when I take away their sins.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">As regards the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved, for the sake of their ancestors;  for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.  Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience,  so they have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy.  For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all.</p> <p>O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For who has known the mind of the Lord?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Or who has been his counselor?”</span><br>“Or who has given a gift to him,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>to receive a gift in return?”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.</p>
