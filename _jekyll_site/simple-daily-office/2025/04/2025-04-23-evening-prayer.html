<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>The time that the Israelites had lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.  At the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the companies of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> went out from the land of Egypt.  That was for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> a night of vigil, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. That same night is a vigil to be kept for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> by all the Israelites throughout their generations.</p> <h3>Directions for the Passover</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance for the passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,  but any slave who has been purchased may eat of it after he has been circumcised;  no bound or hired servant may eat of it.  It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the animal outside the house, and you shall not break any of its bones.  The whole congregation of Israel shall celebrate it.  If an alien who resides with you wants to celebrate the passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, all his males shall be circumcised; then he may draw near to celebrate it; he shall be regarded as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it;  there shall be one law for the native and for the alien who resides among you.</p> <p>All the Israelites did just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron.  That very day the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt, company by company.</p>

 <h3>Peter Heals a Crippled Beggar</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three o’clock in the afternoon.  And a man lame from birth was being carried in. People would lay him daily at the gate of the temple called the Beautiful Gate so that he could ask for alms from those entering the temple.  When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked them for alms.  Peter looked intently at him, as did John, and said, “Look at us.”  And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.  But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I have I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, stand up and walk.”  And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.  Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.  All the people saw him walking and praising God,  and they recognized him as the one who used to sit and ask for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>

in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
