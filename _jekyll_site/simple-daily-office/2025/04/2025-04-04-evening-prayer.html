<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joseph Forgives His Brothers</h3>
<p>Realizing that their father was dead, Joseph’s brothers said, “What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong that we did to him?”  So they approached Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this instruction before he died,  ‘Say to Joseph: I beg you, forgive the crime of your brothers and the wrong they did in harming you.’ Now therefore please forgive the crime of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.  Then his brothers also wept, fell down before him, and said, “We are here as your slaves.”  But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid! Am I in the place of God?  Even though you intended to do harm to me, God intended it for good, in order to preserve a numerous people, as he is doing today.  So have no fear; I myself will provide for you and your little ones.” In this way he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.</p> <h3>Joseph’s Last Days and Death</h3>
<p>So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s household; and Joseph lived one hundred ten years.  Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation; the children of Machir son of Manasseh were also born on Joseph’s knees.</p> <p>Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die; but God will surely come to you, and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”  So Joseph made the Israelites swear, saying, “When God comes to you, you shall carry up my bones from here.”  And Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old; he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.</p>

  <p>Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; *</p> <p class="indent">you are worthy of praise; glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; *</p> <p class="indent">on the throne of your majesty, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you, beholding the depths; *</p> <p class="indent">in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p>

 <p>We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family.  And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p> <h3>God’s Love in Christ Jesus</h3>
<p>What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?  He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else?  Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.  Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us.  Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  As it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For your sake we are being killed all day long;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,  nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
