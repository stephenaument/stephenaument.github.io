<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Two Kinds of Wisdom</h3>
<p>Who is wise and understanding among you? Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom.  But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth.  Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish.  For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind.  But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.  And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</p> <h3>Friendship with the World</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Those conflicts and disputes among you, where do they come from? Do they not come from your cravings that are at war within you?  You want something and do not have it; so you commit murder. And you covet something and cannot obtain it; so you engage in disputes and conflicts. You do not have, because you do not ask.  You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, in order to spend what you get on your pleasures.  Adulterers! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.  Or do you suppose that it is for nothing that the scripture says, “God yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”?  But he gives all the more grace; therefore it says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“God opposes the proud,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but gives grace to the humble.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  Lament and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p> <h3>Warning against Judging Another</h3>
<p>Do not speak evil against one another, brothers and sisters. Whoever speaks evil against another or judges another, speaks evil against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.  There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. So who, then, are you to judge your neighbor?</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>15. The Song of Mary <em class="latin_name">Magnificat</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
