<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>A Man of God from Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">While Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer incense, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to Bethel  and proclaimed against the altar by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “O altar, altar, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘A son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who offer incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.’”  He gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken: ‘The altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.’”  When the king heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” But the hand that he stretched out against him withered so that he could not draw it back to himself.  The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me.” So the man of God entreated the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became as it was before.  Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and dine, and I will give you a gift.”  But the man of God said to the king, “If you give me half your kingdom, I will not go in with you; nor will I eat food or drink water in this place.  For thus I was commanded by the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: You shall not eat food, or drink water, or return by the way that you came.”  So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he had come to Bethel.</p>

<p>When evening had come, and since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,  Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for some time.  When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.  Then Joseph bought a linen cloth, and taking down the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.  Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was laid.</p>
