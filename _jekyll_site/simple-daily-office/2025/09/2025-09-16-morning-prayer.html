<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elijah Pronounces God’s Sentence</h3>
<p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:  Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.  You shall say to him, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Have you killed, and also taken possession?” You shall say to him, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.”</p> <p>Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you found me, O my enemy?” He answered, “I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,  I will bring disaster on you; I will consume you, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;  and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.  Also concerning Jezebel the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the bounds of Jezreel.’  Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat.”</p> <p>(Indeed, there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, urged on by his wife Jezebel.  He acted most abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove out before the Israelites.)</p> <p>When Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth over his bare flesh; he fasted, lay in the sackcloth, and went about dejectedly.  Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Elijah the Tishbite:  “Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son’s days I will bring the disaster on his house.”</p>

 <h3>Jesus Begins His Ministry in Galilee</h3>
<p>Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.  He left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali,  so that what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Land of Zebulun, land of Naphtali,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>on the road by the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—</span><br>the people who sat in darkness<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>have seen a great light,</span><br>and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>light has dawned.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">From that time Jesus began to proclaim, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”</p>
