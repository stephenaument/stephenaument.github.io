<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</p> <p>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</p> <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <p class="top-1">I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus,  for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge of every kind—  just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened among you—  so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ.  He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.  God is faithful; by him you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p> <h3>Divisions in the Church</h3>
<p>Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose.  For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers and sisters.  What I mean is that each of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”  Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?  I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,  so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.  (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)  For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.</p> <h3>Christ the Power and Wisdom of God</h3>
<p>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”</span></p></div>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Lord, you now have set your servant free *</p> <p class"indent">to go in peace as you have promised;</p> <p>For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *</p> <p class"indent">whom you have prepared for all the world to see:</p> <p>A Light to enlighten the nations, *</p> <p class"indent">and the glory of your people Israel.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class"indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
