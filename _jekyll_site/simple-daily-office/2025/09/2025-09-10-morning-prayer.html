<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elijah Predicts a Drought</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.”  The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him, saying,  “Go from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.  You shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”  So he went and did according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; he went and lived by the Wadi Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.  The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the wadi.  But after a while the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.</p> <h3>The Widow of Zarephath</h3>
<p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him, saying,  “Go now to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and live there; for I have commanded a widow there to feed you.”  So he set out and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the town, a widow was there gathering sticks; he called to her and said, “Bring me a little water in a vessel, so that I may drink.”  As she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, “Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”  But she said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; I am now gathering a couple of sticks, so that I may go home and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”  Elijah said to her, “Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son.  For thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sends rain on the earth.”  She went and did as Elijah said, so that she as well as he and her household ate for many days.  The jar of meal was not emptied, neither did the jug of oil fail, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he spoke by Elijah.</p> <h3>Elijah Revives the Widow’s Son</h3>
<p>After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill; his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.  She then said to Elijah, “What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!”  But he said to her, “Give me your son.” He took him from her bosom, carried him up into the upper chamber where he was lodging, and laid him on his own bed.  He cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?”  Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God, let this child’s life come into him again.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.  Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; then Elijah said, “See, your son is alive.”  So the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in your mouth is truth.”</p>

 <h3>The Visit of the Wise Men</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,  asking, “Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.”  When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him;  and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.  They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;</span><br>for from you shall come a ruler<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>who is to shepherd my people Israel.’”</span></p></div> <p>Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared.  Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.”  When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was.  When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy.  On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.</p>
