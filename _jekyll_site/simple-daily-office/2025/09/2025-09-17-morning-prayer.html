<div class="citation">Psalm 43:3</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Joint Campaign with Judah against Aram</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">For three years Aram and Israel continued without war.  But in the third year King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to the king of Israel.  The king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, yet we are doing nothing to take it out of the hand of the king of Aram?”  He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are; my people are your people, my horses are your horses.”</p> <p>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred of them, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?” They said, “Go up; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give it into the hand of the king.”  But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no other prophet of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> here of whom we may inquire?”  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one other by whom we may inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, Micaiah son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies anything favorable about me, but only disaster.” Jehoshaphat said, “Let the king not say such a thing.”  Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah.”  Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.”  All the prophets were prophesying the same and saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give it into the hand of the king.”</p> <h3>Micaiah Predicts Failure</h3>
<p>The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.”  But Micaiah said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, whatever the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> says to me, that I will speak.”</p> <p>When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?” He answered him, “Go up and triumph; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give it into the hand of the king.”  But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?”  Then Micaiah said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, ‘These have no master; let each one go home in peace.’”  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy anything favorable about me, but only disaster?”</p> <p>Then Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I saw the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sitting on his throne, with all the host of heaven standing beside him to the right and to the left of him.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, so that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ Then one said one thing, and another said another,  until a spirit came forward and stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, saying, ‘I will entice him.’  ‘How?’ the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> asked him. He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do it.’  So you see, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has decreed disaster for you.”</p> <p>Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up to Micaiah, slapped him on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> pass from me to speak to you?”  Micaiah replied, “You will find out on that day when you go in to hide in an inner chamber.”  The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,  and say, ‘Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him on reduced rations of bread and water until I come in peace.’”  Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Hear, you peoples, all of you!”</p>

 <h3>Jesus Calls the First Disciples</h3>
<p>As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen.  And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fish for people.”  Immediately they left their nets and followed him.  As he went from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.  Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</p> <h3>Jesus Ministers to Crowds of People</h3>
<p>Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people.  So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all the sick, those who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics, and he cured them.  And great crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.</p>
