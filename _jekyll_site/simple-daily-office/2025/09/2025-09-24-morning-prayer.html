<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Miracle of the Ax Head</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the company of prophets said to Elisha, “As you see, the place where we live under your charge is too small for us.  Let us go to the Jordan, and let us collect logs there, one for each of us, and build a place there for us to live.” He answered, “Do so.”  Then one of them said, “Please come with your servants.” And he answered, “I will.”  So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.  But as one was felling a log, his ax head fell into the water; he cried out, “Alas, master! It was borrowed.”  Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float.  He said, “Pick it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.</p> <h3>The Aramean Attack Is Thwarted</h3>
<p>Once when the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he took counsel with his officers. He said, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”  But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Take care not to pass this place, because the Arameans are going down there.”  The king of Israel sent word to the place of which the man of God spoke. More than once or twice he warned such a place so that it was on the alert.</p> <p>The mind of the king of Aram was greatly perturbed because of this; he called his officers and said to them, “Now tell me who among us sides with the king of Israel?”  Then one of his officers said, “No one, my lord king. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.”  He said, “Go and find where he is; I will send and seize him.” He was told, “He is in Dothan.”  So he sent horses and chariots there and a great army; they came by night, and surrounded the city.</p> <p>When an attendant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. His servant said, “Alas, master! What shall we do?”  He replied, “Do not be afraid, for there are more with us than there are with them.”  Then Elisha prayed: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, please open his eyes that he may see.” So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw; the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.  When the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said, “Strike this people, please, with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.  Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.</p> <p>As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, open the eyes of these men so that they may see.” The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> opened their eyes, and they saw that they were inside Samaria.  When the king of Israel saw them he said to Elisha, “Father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”  He answered, “No! Did you capture with your sword and your bow those whom you want to kill? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink; and let them go to their master.”  So he prepared for them a great feast; after they ate and drank, he sent them on their way, and they went to their master. And the Arameans no longer came raiding into the land of Israel.</p>

 <h3>Concerning Retaliation</h3>
<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’  But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also;  and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well;  and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile.  Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.</p> <h3>Love for Enemies</h3>
<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,  so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.  For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?  And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
