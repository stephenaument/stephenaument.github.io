<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Hoshea Reigns over Israel</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In the twelfth year of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel; he reigned nine years.  He did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, yet not like the kings of Israel who were before him.  King Shalmaneser of Assyria came up against him; Hoshea became his vassal, and paid him tribute.  But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to King So of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria confined him and imprisoned him.</p> <h3>Israel Carried Captive to Assyria</h3>
<p>Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Samaria; for three years he besieged it.  In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria; he carried the Israelites away to Assyria. He placed them in Halah, on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p> <p>This occurred because the people of Israel had sinned against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods  and walked in the customs of the nations whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove out before the people of Israel, and in the customs that the kings of Israel had introduced.  The people of Israel secretly did things that were not right against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God. They built for themselves high places at all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city;  they set up for themselves pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree;  there they made offerings on all the high places, as the nations did whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> carried away before them. They did wicked things, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to anger;  they served idols, of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said to them, “You shall not do this.”  Yet the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.”  They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God.  They despised his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their ancestors, and the warnings that he gave them. They went after false idols and became false; they followed the nations that were around them, concerning whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had commanded them that they should not do as they did.  They rejected all the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God and made for themselves cast images of two calves; they made a sacred pole, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.  They made their sons and their daughters pass through fire; they used divination and augury; and they sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, provoking him to anger.  Therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Calls the First Disciples</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God,  he saw two boats there at the shore of the lake; the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.  He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.  When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”  Simon answered, “Master, we have worked all night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down the nets.”  When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break.  So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.  But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!”  For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken;  and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.”  When they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.</p>
