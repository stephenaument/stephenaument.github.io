<h3 class="date">September 26, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 20</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>In Jezreel, the sentinel standing on the tower spied the company of Jehu arriving, and said, “I see a company.” Joram said, “Take a horseman; send him to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”  So the horseman went to meet him; he said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” Jehu responded, “What have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me.” The sentinel reported, saying, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”  Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me.”  Again the sentinel reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. It looks like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi; for he drives like a maniac.”</p> <p>Joram said, “Get ready.” And they got his chariot ready. Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu; they met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.  When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” He answered, “What peace can there be, so long as the many whoredoms and sorceries of your mother Jezebel continue?”  Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, “Treason, Ahaziah!”  Jehu drew his bow with all his strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart; and he sank in his chariot.  Jehu said to his aide Bidkar, “Lift him out, and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I rode side by side behind his father Ahab how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> uttered this oracle against him:  ‘For the blood of Naboth and for the blood of his children that I saw yesterday, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I swear I will repay you on this very plot of ground.’ Now therefore lift him out and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <h3>Ahaziah of Judah Killed</h3>
<p>When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, saying, “Shoot him also!” And they shot him in the chariot at the ascent to Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to Megiddo, and died there.  His officers carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the city of David.</p> <p>In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.</p> <h3>Jezebel’s Violent Death</h3>
<p>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window.  As Jehu entered the gate, she said, “Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?”  He looked up to the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.  He said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down; some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, which trampled on her.  Then he went in and ate and drank; he said, “See to that cursed woman and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.”  But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.  When they came back and told him, he said, “This is the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, ‘In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;  the corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung on the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.’”</p>
