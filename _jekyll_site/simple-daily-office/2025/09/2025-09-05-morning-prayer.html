<h3 class="date">September 05, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 17</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Jeroboam’s Rebellion</h3>
<p>Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, rebelled against the king.  The following was the reason he rebelled against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.  The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.  About that time, when Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Ahijah had clothed himself with a new garment. The two of them were alone in the open country  when Ahijah laid hold of the new garment he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.  He then said to Jeroboam: Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, “See, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes.  One tribe will remain his, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.  This is because he has forsaken me, worshiped Astarte the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as his father David did.  Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom away from him but will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of my servant David whom I chose and who did keep my commandments and my statutes;  but I will take the kingdom away from his son and give it to you—that is, the ten tribes.  Yet to his son I will give one tribe, so that my servant David may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.  I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires; you shall be king over Israel.  If you will listen to all that I command you, walk in my ways, and do what is right in my sight by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you an enduring house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.  For this reason I will punish the descendants of David, but not forever.”  Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam promptly fled to Egypt, to King Shishak of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p> <h3>Death of Solomon</h3>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did as well as his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?  The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.  Solomon slept with his ancestors and was buried in the city of his father David; and his son Rehoboam succeeded him.</p>

  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<p> Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).  And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.  And they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots to decide what each should take.</p> <p>It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.  The inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.”  And with him they crucified two bandits, one on his right and one on his left.  Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,  save yourself, and come down from the cross!”  In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself.  Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.</p>
