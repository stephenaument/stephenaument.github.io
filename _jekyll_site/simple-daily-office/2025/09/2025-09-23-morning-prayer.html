<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <p class="indent">and a great King above all gods.</p>
  <p>In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and the heights of the hills are his also.</p>
  <p>The sea is his, for he made it, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and his hands have molded the dry land.</p>
  <p class="space">Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
  <p>For he is our God,</p>
  <p>and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. *</p>
  <p class="indent">Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!</p>

<p> He said to him, “Go in peace.”</p>
<h3>Gehazi’s Greed</h3>
<p>But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance,  Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “My master has let that Aramean Naaman off too lightly by not accepting from him what he offered. As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, I will run after him and get something out of him.”  So Gehazi went after Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he jumped down from the chariot to meet him and said, “Is everything all right?”  He replied, “Yes, but my master has sent me to say, ‘Two members of a company of prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim; please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”  Naaman said, “Please accept two talents.” He urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them in front of Gehazi.  When he came to the citadel, he took the bags from them, and stored them inside; he dismissed the men, and they left.</p> <p>He went in and stood before his master; and Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” He answered, “Your servant has not gone anywhere at all.”  But he said to him, “Did I not go with you in spirit when someone left his chariot to meet you? Is this a time to accept money and to accept clothing, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, and male and female slaves?  Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you, and to your descendants forever.” So he left his presence leprous, as white as snow.</p>

<h3>13. A Song of Praise <em class="latin_name">Benedictus es, Domine</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; *</p> <p class="indent">you are worthy of praise; glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; *</p> <p class="indent">on the throne of your majesty, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to you, beholding the depths; *</p> <p class="indent">in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.</p> <p>Glory to you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; *</p> <p class="indent">we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever.</p>

<p> So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you,  leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or sister, and then come and offer your gift.  Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him, or your accuser may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison.  Truly I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.</p> <h3>Concerning Adultery</h3>
<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’  But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.  And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.</p> <h3>Concerning Divorce</h3>
<p>“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’  But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p> <h3>Concerning Oaths</h3>
<p>“Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.’  But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,  or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.  And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.  Let your word be ‘Yes, Yes’ or ‘No, No’; anything more than this comes from the evil one.</p>
