<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<p> In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel; he reigned for twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.</p> <h3>Samaria the New Capital</h3>
<p>He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; he fortified the hill, and called the city that he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.</p> <p>Omri did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; he did more evil than all who were before him.  For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and in the sins that he caused Israel to commit, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.  Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the power that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?  Omri slept with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria; his son Ahab succeeded him.</p> <h3>Ahab Reigns over Israel</h3>
<p>In the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah, Ahab son of Omri began to reign over Israel; Ahab son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.

<p>And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he took as his wife Jezebel daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.  He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.  Ahab also made a sacred pole. Ahab did more to provoke the anger of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, than had all the kings of Israel who were before him.  In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho; he laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which he spoke by Joshua son of Nun.</p>

 <h3>The Resurrection of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.  And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.  They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”  When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back.  As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.  But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.  But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.”  So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</p>
<h4><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">The Shorter Ending of Mark</span></h4>
<p>[[And all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter. And afterward Jesus himself sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.]]</p> <h4><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">The Longer Ending of Mark</span></h4>
<h3>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</h3>
<p>[[Now after he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.  She went out and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping.  But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.</p> <h3>Jesus Appears to Two Disciples</h3>
<p>After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.  And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.</p> <h3>Jesus Commissions the Disciples</h3>
<p>Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.  And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation.  The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.  And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;  they will pick up snakes in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</p> <h3>The Ascension of Jesus</h3>
<p>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.  And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it.]]</p>
