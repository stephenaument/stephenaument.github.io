<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>So Solomon held the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a great assembly, people from Lebo-hamath to the Wadi of Egypt—before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, seven days.  On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents, joyful and in good spirits because of all the goodness that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had shown to his servant David and to his people Israel.</p> <h3>God Appears Again to Solomon</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When Solomon had finished building the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and the king’s house and all that Solomon desired to build,  the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you made before me; I have consecrated this house that you have built, and put my name there forever; my eyes and my heart will be there for all time.  As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances,  then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a successor on the throne of Israel.’</p> <p>“If you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,  then I will cut Israel off from the land that I have given them; and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel will become a proverb and a taunt among all peoples.  This house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> done such a thing to this land and to this house?’  Then they will say, ‘Because they have forsaken the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> their God, who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, worshiping them and serving them; therefore the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has brought this disaster upon them.’”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Peter Denies Jesus</h3>
<p>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came by.  When she saw Peter warming himself, she stared at him and said, “You also were with Jesus, the man from Nazareth.”  But he denied it, saying, “I do not know or understand what you are talking about.” And he went out into the forecourt. Then the cock crowed.  And the servant-girl, on seeing him, began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”  But again he denied it. Then after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.”  But he began to curse, and he swore an oath, “I do not know this man you are talking about.”  At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him, “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.</p>

 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
