<h3 class="date">September 20, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Saturday In The Week Of Proper 19</h3>


<div class="citation">Isaiah 57:15</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, “I dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Elijah Ascends to Heaven</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.  Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.  The company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will take your master away from you?” And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent.”</p> <p>Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.  The company of prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that today the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will take your master away from you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know; be silent.”</p> <p>Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.  Fifty men of the company of prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.  Then Elijah took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, until the two of them crossed on dry ground.</p> <p>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.”  He responded, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.”  As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a whirlwind into heaven.  Elisha kept watching and crying out, “Father, father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” But when he could no longer see him, he grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.</p> <h3>Elisha Succeeds Elijah</h3>
<p>He picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.  He took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, “Where is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Elijah?” When he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.</p> <p>When the company of prophets who were at Jericho saw him at a distance, they declared, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.  They said to him, “See now, we have fifty strong men among your servants; please let them go and seek your master; it may be that the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has caught him up and thrown him down on some mountain or into some valley.” He responded, “No, do not send them.”  But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” So they sent fifty men who searched for three days but did not find him.  When they came back to him (he had remained at Jericho), he said to them, “Did I not say to you, Do not go?”</p>

 <h3>The Law and the Prophets</h3>
<p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
