<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Job Is Humbled and Satisfied</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Job answered the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I know that you can do all things,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</span><br>‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’<br>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</span><br>‘Hear, and I will speak;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I will question you, and you declare to me.’</span><br>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but now my eye sees you;</span><br>therefore I despise myself,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and repent in dust and ashes.”</span></p></div> <h3>Job’s Friends Are Humiliated</h3>
<p>After the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken these words to Job, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.  Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has done.”  So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had told them; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> accepted Job’s prayer.</p> <h3>Job’s Fortunes Are Restored Twofold</h3>
<p>And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before.  Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a gold ring.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys.  He also had seven sons and three daughters.  He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.  In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.  After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children’s children, four generations.  And Job died, old and full of days.</p>

 <h3>Proclaiming Christ Crucified</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom.  For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.  And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.  My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,  so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.</p> <h3>The True Wisdom of God</h3>
<p>Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish.  But we speak God’s wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.  None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  But, as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor the human heart conceived,</span><br>what God has prepared for those who love him”—</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.  For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one comprehends what is truly God’s except the Spirit of God.  Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.  And we speak of these things in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things to those who are spiritual.</p>
