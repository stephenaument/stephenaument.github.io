</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Defeat and Death of Ahab</h3>
<p>So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.  The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.  Now the king of Aram had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”  When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is surely the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him; and Jehoshaphat cried out.  When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.  But a certain man drew his bow and unknowingly struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; so he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”  The battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans, until at evening he died; the blood from the wound had flowed into the bottom of the chariot.  Then about sunset a shout went through the army, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”</p> <p>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; they buried the king in Samaria.  They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; the dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he had spoken.  Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?  So Ahab slept with his ancestors; and his son Ahaziah succeeded him.</p> <h3>Jehoshaphat Reigns over Judah</h3>
<p>Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab of Israel.  Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.  He walked in all the way of his father Asa; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and offered incense on the high places.  Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.</p> <p>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his power that he showed, and how he waged war, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?  </p>
