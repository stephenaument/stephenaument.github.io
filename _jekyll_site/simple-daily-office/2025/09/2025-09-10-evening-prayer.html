<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h3>


  <h3>Psalm 49</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>Hear this, all you peoples;</p><p>hearken, all you who dwell in the world, *</p><p class="indent">you of high degree and low, rich and poor together.</p><p class="space">My mouth shall speak of wisdom, *</p><p class="indent">and my heart shall meditate on understanding.</p><p class="space">I will incline my ear to a proverb *</p><p class="indent">and set forth my riddle upon the harp.</p><p class="space">Why should I be afraid in evil days, *</p><p class="indent">when the wickedness of those at my heels surrounds me,</p><p class="space">The wickedness of those who put their trust in their goods, *</p><p class="indent">and boast of their great riches?</p><p class="space">We can never ransom ourselves, *</p><p class="indent">or deliver to God the price of our life;</p><p class="space">For the ransom of our life is so great, *</p><p class="indent">that we should never have enough to pay it,</p><p class="space">In order to live for ever and ever, *</p><p class="indent">and never see the grave.</p><p class="space">For we see that the wise die also;</p><p>like the dull and stupid they perish *</p><p class="indent">and leave their wealth to those who come after them.</p><p>Their graves shall be their homes for ever,</p><p>their dwelling places from generation to generation, *</p><p class="indent">though they call the lands after their own names.</p><p class="space">Even though honored, they cannot live for ever; *</p><p class="indent">they are like the beasts that perish.</p><p class="space">Such is the way of those who foolishly trust in themselves, *</p><p class="indent">and the end of those who delight in their own words.</p><p class="space">Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die;</p><p>Death is their shepherd; *</p><p class="indent">they go down straightway to the grave.</p><p class="space">Their form shall waste away, *</p><p class="indent">and the land of the dead shall be their home.</p><p class="space">But God will ransom my life; *</p><p class="indent">he will snatch me from the grasp of death.</p><p class="space">Do not be envious when some become rich, *</p><p class="indent">or when the grandeur of their house increases;</p><p class="space">For they will carry nothing away at their death, *</p><p class="indent">nor will their grandeur follow them.</p><p class="space">Though they thought highly of themselves while they lived, *</p><p class="indent">and were praised for their success,</p><p class="space">They shall join the company of their forebears, *</p><p class="indent">who will never see the light again.</p><p class="space">Those who are honored, but have no understanding, *</p><p class="indent">are like the beasts that perish.</p>
  </div>

  <p> Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.
  </p>

  <h3>Psalm 53</h3>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." *</p><p class="indent">All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;</p><p class="indent">there is none who does any good.</p><p>God looks down from heaven upon us all, *</p><p class="indent">to see if there is any who is wise,</p><p class="indent">if there is one who seeks after God.</p><p class="space">Every one has proved faithless;</p><p>all alike have turned bad; *</p><p class="indent">there is none who does good; no, not one.</p><p class="space">Have they no knowledge, those evildoers *</p><p class="indent">who eat up my people like bread</p><p class="indent">and do not call upon God?</p><p class="space">See how greatly they tremble,</p><p>such trembling as never was; *</p><p class="indent">for God has scattered the bones of the enemy;</p><p class="indent">they are put to shame, because God has rejected them.</p><p class="space">Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *</p><p class="indent">when God restores the fortunes of his people</p><p class="indent">Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.</p>

  <p> Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
