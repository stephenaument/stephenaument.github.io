<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>

and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>

 <h3>Naboth’s Vineyard</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Later the following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.  And Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.”  But Naboth said to Ahab, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> forbid that I should give you my ancestral inheritance.”  Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, “I will not give you my ancestral inheritance.” He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat.</p> <p>His wife Jezebel came to him and said, “Why are you so depressed that you will not eat?”  He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it’; but he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”  His wife Jezebel said to him, “Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”</p> <p>So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal; she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city.  She wrote in the letters, “Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly;  seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against him, saying, ‘You have cursed God and the king.’ Then take him out, and stone him to death.”  The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them,  they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly.  The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death.  Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.”</p> <p>As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”  As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p>

 <h3>The Temptation of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.  He fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterwards he was famished.  The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”  But he answered, “It is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘One does not live by bread alone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</span></p></div> <p>Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,  saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘He will command his angels concerning you,’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and ‘On their hands they will bear you up,</span><br>so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”</p> <p>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor;  and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”  Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! for it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘Worship the Lord your God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and serve only him.’”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels came and waited on him.</p>
