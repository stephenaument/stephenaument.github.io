</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Anointing of Jehu</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then the prophet Elisha called a member of the company of prophets and said to him, “Gird up your loins; take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.  When you arrive, look there for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi; go in and get him to leave his companions, and take him into an inner chamber.  Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and flee; do not linger.”</p> <p>So the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.  He arrived while the commanders of the army were in council, and he announced, “I have a message for you, commander.” “For which one of us?” asked Jehu. “For you, commander.”  So Jehu got up and went inside; the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel: I anoint you king over the people of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, over Israel.  You shall strike down the house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.  I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.  The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and no one shall bury her.” Then he opened the door and fled.</p> <p>When Jehu came back to his master’s officers, they said to him, “Is everything all right? Why did that madman come to you?” He answered them, “You know the sort and how they babble.”  They said, “Liar! Come on, tell us!” So he said, “This is just what he said to me: ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I anoint you king over Israel.’”  Then hurriedly they all took their cloaks and spread them for him on the bare steps; and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, “Jehu is king.”</p> <h3>Joram of Israel Killed</h3>
<p>Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against King Hazael of Aram;  but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him, when he fought against King Hazael of Aram. So Jehu said, “If this is your wish, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.”  Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, where Joram was lying ill. King Ahaziah of Judah had come down to visit Joram.</p>

 <h3>Concerning Almsgiving</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">“Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.</p> <p>“So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.  But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,  so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p> <h3>Concerning Prayer</h3>
<p>“And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.  But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p>
