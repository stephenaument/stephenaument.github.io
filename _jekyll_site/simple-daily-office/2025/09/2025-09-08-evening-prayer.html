<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Elihu Rebukes Job’s Friends</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.  Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job because he justified himself rather than God;  he was angry also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, though they had declared Job to be in the wrong.  Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.  But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry.</p> <p>Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answered:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I am young in years,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and you are aged;</span><br>therefore I was timid and afraid<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>to declare my opinion to you.</span><br>I said, ‘Let days speak,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and many years teach wisdom.’</span><br>But truly it is the spirit in a mortal,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the breath of the Almighty, that makes for understanding.</span><br>It is not the old that are wise,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor the aged that understand what is right.</span><br>Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>let me also declare my opinion.’</span></p></div>

 <h3>Job Replies: I Know That My Redeemer Lives</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Job answered:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“How long will you torment me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and break me in pieces with words?</span><br>These ten times you have cast reproach upon me;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>are you not ashamed to wrong me?</span><br>And even if it is true that I have erred,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>my error remains with me.</span><br>If indeed you magnify yourselves against me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and make my humiliation an argument against me,</span><br>know then that God has put me in the wrong,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and closed his net around me.</span><br>Even when I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I am not answered;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I call aloud, but there is no justice.</span><br>He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and he has set darkness upon my paths.</span><br>He has stripped my glory from me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and taken the crown from my head.</span><br>He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>he has uprooted my hope like a tree.</span><br>He has kindled his wrath against me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and counts me as his adversary.</span><br>His troops come on together;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they have thrown up siegeworks against me,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and encamp around my tent.</span></p></div> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">“He has put my family far from me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.</span><br>My relatives and my close friends have failed me;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>the guests in my house have forgotten me;</span><br>my serving girls count me as a stranger;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I have become an alien in their eyes.</span><br>I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I must myself plead with him.</span><br>My breath is repulsive to my wife;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>I am loathsome to my own family.</span><br>Even young children despise me;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>when I rise, they talk against me.</span><br>All my intimate friends abhor me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and those whom I loved have turned against me.</span><br>My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</span><br>Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for the hand of God has touched me!</span><br>Why do you, like God, pursue me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>never satisfied with my flesh?</span></p></div> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">“O that my words were written down!<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>O that they were inscribed in a book!</span><br>O that with an iron pen and with lead<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they were engraved on a rock forever!</span><br>For I know that my Redeemer lives,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and that at the last he will stand upon the earth;</span><br>and after my skin has been thus destroyed,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>then in my flesh I shall see God,</span><br>whom I shall see on my side,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and my eyes shall behold, and not another.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>My heart faints within me!</span><br>If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and, ‘The root of the matter is found in him’;</span><br>be afraid of the sword,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for wrath brings the punishment of the sword,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>so that you may know there is a judgment.”</span></p></div> <h3>Zophar Speaks: Wickedness Receives Just Retribution</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Pay attention!

class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>ever since mortals were placed on earth,</span><br>that the exulting of the wicked is short,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the joy of the godless is but for a moment?</span><br>Even though they mount up high as the heavens,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and their head reaches to the

will fly away like a dream, and not be found;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they will be chased away like a vision of the night.</span><br>The eye that saw them will see them no more,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>nor will their place behold them any longer.</span><br>Their children will seek the favor of the

class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>God will send his fierce anger into them,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and rain it upon them as their food.</span><br>They will flee from an iron weapon;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>a bronze arrow will strike them through.</span><br>It is drawn forth and comes out of their body,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the glittering point comes out of their gall;</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span

<p>I thank my God every time I remember you,  constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you,  because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now.  I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ.  It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because you hold me in your heart, for all of you share in God’s grace with me, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.  For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.  And this is my prayer, that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight  to help you to determine what is best, so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless,  having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God.</p>

<p>Most holy God, the source of all good desires, all right judgments, and all just works: Give to us, your servants, that peace which the world cannot give, so that our minds may be fixed on the doing of your will, and that we, being delivered from the fear of all enemies, may live in peace and quietness; through the mercies of Christ Jesus our Savior. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>O God and Father of all, whom the whole heavens adore: Let the whole earth also worship you, all nations obey you, all tongues confess and bless you, and men and women everywhere love you and serve you in peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
</p>


<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>
  
<p class="poetry">
  
  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
</p>
