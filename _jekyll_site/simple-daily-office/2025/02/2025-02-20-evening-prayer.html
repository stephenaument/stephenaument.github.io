<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Jacob Sends Presents to Appease Esau</h3>
<p>Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,  instructing them, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, ‘I have lived with Laban as an alien, and stayed until now;  and I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male and female slaves; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.’”</p> <p>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”  Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies,  thinking, “If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the company that is left will escape.”</p> <p>And Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will do you good,’  I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.  Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him; he may come and kill us all, the mothers with the children.  Yet you have said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted because of their number.’”</p> <p>So he spent that night there, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,  two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,  thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.  These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass on ahead of me, and put a space between drove and drove.”  He instructed the foremost, “When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, ‘To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?’  then you shall say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.’”  He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, “You shall say the same thing to Esau when you meet him,  and you shall say, ‘Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.’” For he thought, “I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me.”  So the present passed on ahead of him; and he himself spent that night in the camp.</p>

<h3>11. The Third Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Surge, illuminare</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Arise, shine, for your light has come, *</p> <p class="indent">and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you.</p> <p>For behold, darkness covers the land; *</p> <p class="indent">deep gloom enshrouds the peoples.</p> <p>But over you the Lord will rise, *</p> <p class="indent">and his glory will appear upon you.</p> <p>Nations will stream to your light, *</p> <p class="indent">and kings to the brightness of your dawning.</p> <p>Your gates will always be open; *</p> <p class="indent">by day or night they will never be shut.</p> <p>They will call you, The City of the Lord, *</p> <p class="indent">The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p> <p>Violence will no more be heard in your land, *</p> <p class="indent">ruin or destruction within your borders.</p> <p>You will call your walls, Salvation, *</p> <p class="indent">and all your portals, Praise.</p> <p>The sun will no more be your light by day; *</p> <p class="indent">by night you will not need the brightness of the moon.</p> <p>The Lord will be your everlasting light, *</p> <p class="indent">and your God will be your glory.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <h3>False Asceticism</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,  through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron.  They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.  For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, provided it is received with thanksgiving;  for it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer.</p> <h3>A Good Minister of Jesus Christ</h3>
<p>If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed.  Have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives’ tales. Train yourself in godliness,  for, while physical training is of some value, godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.  The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance.  For to this end we toil and struggle, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.</p> <p>These are the things you must insist on and teach.  Let no one despise your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.  Until I arrive, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhorting, to teaching.  Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.  Put these things into practice, devote yourself to them, so that all may see your progress.  Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
