<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Isaac Blesses Jacob</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called his elder son Esau and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.”  He said, “See, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.  Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me.  Then prepare for me savory food, such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.”</p> <p>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,  Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father say to your brother Esau,  ‘Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food to eat, that I may bless you before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> before I die.’  Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you.  Go to the flock, and get me two choice kids, so that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he likes;  and you shall take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”  But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a man of smooth skin.  Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse on myself and not a blessing.”  His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my word, and go, get them for me.”  So he went and got them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved.  Then Rebekah took the best garments of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob;  and she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.  Then she handed the savory food, and the bread that she had prepared, to her son Jacob.</p> <p>So he went in to his father, and said, “My father”; and he said, “Here I am; who are you, my son?”  Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me.”  But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God granted me success.”  Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.”  So Jacob went up to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”  He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.  He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.”  Then he said, “Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son’s game and bless you.” So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.  Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.”  So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Ah, the smell of my son<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>is like the smell of a field that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has blessed.</span><br>May God give you of the dew of heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and of the fatness of the earth,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and plenty of grain and wine.</span><br>Let peoples serve you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and nations bow down to you.</span><br>Be lord over your brothers,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and may your mother’s sons bow down to you.</span><br>Cursed be everyone who curses you,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and blessed be everyone who blesses you!”</span></p></div>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>You are aware that all who are in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.  May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;  when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me  —may the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well how much service he rendered in Ephesus.</p> <h3>A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">You then, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus;  and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well.  Share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.  No one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs; the soldier’s aim is to please the enlisting officer.  And in the case of an athlete, no one is crowned without competing according to the rules.  It is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of the crops.  Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</p> <p>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David—that is my gospel,  for which I suffer hardship, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained.  Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.  The saying is sure:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">If we have died with him, we will also live with him;<br>if we endure, we will also reign with him;<br>if we deny him, he will also deny us;<br>if we are faithless, he remains faithful—<br>for he cannot deny himself.</p></div>  <!--end of footnotes-->
