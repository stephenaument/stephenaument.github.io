<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Tradition of the Elders</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him,  they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them.  (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands, thus observing the tradition of the elders;  and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it; and there are also many other traditions that they observe, the washing of cups, pots, and bronze kettles.)  So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?”  He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">‘This people honors me with their lips,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>but their hearts are far from me;</span><br>in vain do they worship me,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>teaching human precepts as doctrines.’</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.”</p> <p>Then he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition!  For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.’  But you say that if anyone tells father or mother, ‘Whatever support you might have had from me is Corban’ (that is, an offering to God)—  then you no longer permit doing anything for a father or mother,  thus making void the word of God through your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many things like this.”</p> <p>Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand:  there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile.”</p> <p>When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.  He said to them, “Then do you also fail to understand? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile,  since it enters, not the heart but the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)  And he said, “It is what comes out of a person that defiles.  For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder,  adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly.  All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”</p>

  <p>O ruler of the universe, Lord God,</p> <p>great deeds are they that you have done, *</p> <p class="indent">surpassing human understanding.</p> <p>Your ways are ways of righteousness and truth, *</p> <p class="indent">O King of all the ages.</p> <p class="space">Who can fail to do you homage, Lord,</p> <p>and sing the praises of your Name? *</p> <p class="indent">for you only are the Holy One.</p> <p>All nations will draw near and fall down before you, *</p> <p class="indent">because your just and holy works have been revealed.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
