<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.  You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.  No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him.  Little children, let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.  Everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.  Those who have been born of God do not sin, because God’s seed abides in them; they cannot sin, because they have been born of God.  The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way: all who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are those who do not love their brothers and sisters.</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>O Lord, you have taught us that without love whatever we<br>do is worth nothing; Send your Holy Spirit and pour into our<br>hearts your greatest gift, which is love, the true bond of peace<br>and of all virtue, without which whoever lives is accounted<br>dead before you. Grant this for the sake of your only Son<br>Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br>Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Sundays</h3>

Amen.</p>

<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>
  
<p class="poetry">
  
  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
</p>


<p>
Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
