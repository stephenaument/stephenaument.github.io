<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.  Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.  As soon as he had seen the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man; and there he was, standing by the camels at the spring.  He said, “Come in, O blessed of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?”  So the man came into the house; and Laban unloaded the camels, and gave him straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.  Then food was set before him to eat; but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my errand.” He said, “Speak on.”</p> <p>So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.  And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and he has given him all that he has.  My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;  but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’  </p>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.  Let us not become conceited, competing against one another, envying one another.</p> <h3>Bear One Another’s Burdens</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">My friends, if anyone is detected in a transgression, you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Take care that you yourselves are not tempted.  Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.  For if those who are nothing think they are something, they deceive themselves.  All must test their own work; then that work, rather than their neighbor’s work, will become a cause for pride.  For all must carry their own loads.</p> <p>Those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher.</p> <p>Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow.  If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit.  So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest time, if we do not give up.  So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
