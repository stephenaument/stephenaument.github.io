<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <p>The sea is his, for he made it, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and his hands have molded the dry land.</p>
  <p class="space">Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
  <p>For he is our God,</p>

 <h3>The Question about Paying Taxes</h3>
<p>Then they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to trap him in what he said.  And they came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?  Should we pay them, or should we not?” But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you putting me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.”  And they brought one. Then he said to them, “Whose head is this, and whose title?” They answered, “The emperor’s.”  Jesus said to them, “Give to the emperor the things that are the emperor’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were utterly amazed at him.</p> <h3>The Question about the Resurrection</h3>
<p>Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question, saying,  “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no child, the man shall marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.  There were seven brothers; the first married and, when he died, left no children;  and the second married the widow and died, leaving no children; and the third likewise;  none of the seven left children. Last of all the woman herself died.  In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had married her.”</p> <p>Jesus said to them, “Is not this the reason you are wrong, that you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God?  For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.  And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?  He is God not of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.”</p>
