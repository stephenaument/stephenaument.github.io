<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of 4 Epiphany</h3>


<div class="citation">Malachi 1:11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">From the rising of the sun to its setting my Name shall be great among the nations, and in every place incense shall be offered to my Name, and a pure offering; for my Name shall be great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

    <p>Save me, O God, *</p><p class="indent">for the waters have risen up to my neck.</p><p class="space">I am sinking in deep mire, *</p><p class="indent">and there is no firm ground for my feet.</p><p class="space">I have come into deep waters, *</p><p class="indent">and the torrent washes over me.</p><p class="space">I have grown weary with my crying;</p><p>my throat is inflamed; *</p><p class="indent">my eyes have failed from looking for my God.</p><p class="space">Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;</p><p>my lying foes who would destroy me are mighty. *</p><p class="indent">Must I then give back what I never stole?</p><p class="space">O God, you know my foolishness, *</p><p class="indent">and my faults are not hidden from you.</p><p class="space">Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, Lord GOD of hosts; *</p><p class="indent">let not those who seek you be disgraced because of me, O God of Israel.</p><p>Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, *</p><p class="indent">and shame has covered my face.</p><p class="space">I have become a stranger to my own kindred, *</p><p class="indent">an alien to my mother's children.</p><p class="space">Zeal for your house has eaten me up; *</p><p class="indent">the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.</p><p class="space">I humbled myself with fasting, *</p><p class="indent">but that was turned to my reproach.</p><p class="space">I put on sack-cloth also, *</p><p class="indent">and became a byword among them.</p><p class="space">Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, *</p><p class="indent">and the drunkards make songs about me.</p><p class="space">But as for me, this is my prayer to you, *</p><p class="indent">at the time you have set, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>:</p><p class="space">"In your great mercy, O God, *</p><p class="indent">answer me with your unfailing help.</p><p class="space">Save me from the mire;

*</p><p class="indent">your help, O God, will lift me up on high.</p><p class="space">I will praise the Name of God in song; *</p><p class="indent">I will proclaim his greatness with thanksgiving.</p><p class="space">This will please the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> more than an offering of oxen, *</p><p class="indent">more than bullocks with horns and hoofs.</p><p>The afflicted shall see and be glad; *</p><p class="indent">you who seek God, your heart shall live.</p><p class="space">For the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> listens to the needy, *</p><p class="indent">and his prisoners he does not despise.</p><p class="space">Let the heavens and the earth praise him, *</p><p class="indent">the seas and all that moves in them;</p><p class="space">For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah;

 <h3>The Transfiguration</h3>
<p>Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,  and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no one on earth could bleach them.  And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, who were talking with Jesus.  Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  He did not know what to say, for they were terrified.  Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud there came a voice, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”  Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.</p> <h3>The Coming of Elijah</h3>
<p>As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no one about what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.  So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead could mean.  Then they asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”  He said to them, “Elijah is indeed coming first to restore all things. How then is it written about the Son of Man, that he is to go through many sufferings and be treated with contempt?  But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written about him.”</p>
