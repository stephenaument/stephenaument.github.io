<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p class="chapter-2">When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die!”  Jacob became very angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”  Then she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees and that I too may have children through her.”  So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife; and Jacob went in to her.  And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.  Then Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son”; therefore she named him Dan.  Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.  Then Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed”; so she named him Naphtali.</p> <p>When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.  Then Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.  And Leah said, “Good fortune!” so she named him Gad.  Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.  And Leah said, “Happy am I! For the women will call me happy”; so she named him Asher.</p> <p>In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”  But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” Rachel said, “Then he may lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”  When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.  And God heeded Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.  Leah said, “God has given me my hire because I gave my maid to my husband”; so she named him Issachar.  And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.  Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons”; so she named him Zebulun.  Afterwards she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.</p> <p>Then God remembered Rachel, and God heeded her and opened her womb.  She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach”;  and she named him Joseph, saying, “May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> add to me another son!”</p>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</p> <p>To Timothy, my loyal child in the faith:</p>
<p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p> <h3>Warning against False Teachers</h3>
<p>I urge you, as I did when I was on my way to Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine,  and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith.  But the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.  Some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk,  desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions.</p> <p>Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it legitimately.  This means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient, for the godless and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their father or mother, for murderers,  fornicators, sodomites, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching  that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</p> <h3>Gratitude for Mercy</h3>
<p>I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service,  even though I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a man of violence. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,  and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.  The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the foremost.  But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display the utmost patience, making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life.  To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

Amen.
