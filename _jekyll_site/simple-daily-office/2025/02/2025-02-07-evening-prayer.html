<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If I say, “Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light around me turn to night,” darkness is not dark to you, O Lord; the night is as bright as the day; darkness and light to you are both alike.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had blessed Abraham in all things.  Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh  and I will make you swear by the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,  but will go to my country and to my kindred and get a wife for my son Isaac.”  The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land; must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”  Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, ‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.  But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.”  So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.</p> <p>Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking all kinds of choice gifts from his master; and he set out and went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.  He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water; it was toward evening, the time when women go out to draw water.  And he said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.  I am standing here by the spring of water, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.  Let the girl to whom I shall say, ‘Please offer your jar that I may drink,’ and who shall say, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels’—let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.”</p> <p>Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, coming out with her water jar on her shoulder.  The girl was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.  Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me sip a little water from your jar.”  “Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.  When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.”  So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.  The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether or not the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had made his journey successful.</p> <p>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,  and said, “Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”  She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”  She added, “We have plenty of straw and fodder and a place to spend the night.”  The man bowed his head and worshiped the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>  and said, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has led me on the way to the house of my master’s kin.”</p>

 <h3>The Works of the Flesh</h3>
<p>Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.  For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want.  But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law.  Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness,  idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions,  envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</p> <h3>The Fruit of the Spirit</h3>
<p>By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness,  gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.  And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  </p>
