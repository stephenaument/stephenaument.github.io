<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>David Anointed as King</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”  Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.” And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.’  Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for me the one whom I name to you.”  Samuel did what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”  He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</p> <p>When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s anointed is now before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> does not see as mortals see; they look on the outward appearance, but the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> looks on the heart.”  Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> chosen this one.”  Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has not chosen any of these.”  Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.”  He sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Rise and anoint him; for this is the one.”  Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set out and went to Ramah.</p>

 <h3>Warning against Antichrists</h3>
<p>Children, it is the last hour! As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is the last hour.  They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us.  But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge.  I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and you know that no lie comes from the truth.  Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.  No one who denies the Son has the Father; everyone who confesses the Son has the Father also.  Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father.  And this is what he has promised us, eternal life.</p>
