<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing comes from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; we cannot speak to you anything bad or good.  Look, Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has spoken.”</p> <p>When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.  Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they rose in the morning, he said, “Send me back to my master.”  Her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.”  But he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has made my journey successful; let me go that I may go to my master.”  They said, “We will call the girl, and ask her.”  And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will.”  So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men.  And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“May you, our sister, become<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>thousands of myriads;</span><br>may your offspring gain possession<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>of the gates of their foes.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</p> <p>Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb.  Isaac went out in the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming.  And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from the camel,  and said to the servant, “Who is the man over there, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself.  And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.  Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.</p>

 <h3>The Example of Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,  looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.</p> <p>Consider him who endured such hostility against himself from sinners, so that you may not grow weary or lose heart.  In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.  And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children—</p>
