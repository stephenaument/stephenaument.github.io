<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Postponement of Paul’s Visit</h3>
<p>Indeed, this is our boast, the testimony of our conscience: we have behaved in the world with frankness and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God—and all the more toward you.  For we write you nothing other than what you can read and also understand; I hope you will understand until the end—  as you have already understood us in part—that on the day of the Lord Jesus we are your boast even as you are our boast.</p> <p>Since I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double favor;  I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on to Judea.  Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to ordinary human standards, ready to say “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time?  As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been “Yes and No.”  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not “Yes and No”; but in him it is always “Yes.”  For in him every one of God’s promises is a “Yes.” For this reason it is through him that we say the “Amen,” to the glory of God.  But it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us,  by putting his seal on us and giving us his Spirit in our hearts as a first installment.</p>
