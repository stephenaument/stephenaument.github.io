<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Treasure in Clay Jars</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.  We have renounced the shameful things that one hides; we refuse to practice cunning or to falsify God’s word; but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to the conscience of everyone in the sight of God.  And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.  In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.  For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.  For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us.  We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;  persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;  always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies.  For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in us, but life in you.</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>O Lord, you have taught us that without love whatever we<br>do is worth nothing; Send your Holy Spirit and pour into our<br>hearts your greatest gift, which is love, the true bond of peace<br>and of all virtue, without which whoever lives is accounted<br>dead before you. Grant this for the sake of your only Son<br>Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy<br>Spirit, one God, now and for ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Fridays</h3>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.
</p>


<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>
  
<p class="poetry">
  
  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
