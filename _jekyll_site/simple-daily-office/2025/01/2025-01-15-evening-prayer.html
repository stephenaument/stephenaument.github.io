<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Cain Murders Abel</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have produced a man with the help of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”  Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.  In the course of time Cain brought to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> an offering of the fruit of the ground,  and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had regard for Abel and his offering,  but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?  If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.”</p> <p>Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He said, “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?”  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “What have you done? Listen; your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground!  And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.  When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”  Cain said to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, “My punishment is greater than I can bear!  Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to him, “Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance.” And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.  Then Cain went away from the presence of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</p>

 <h3>From Death to Life</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">You were dead through the trespasses and sins  in which you once lived, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient.  All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else.  But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us  even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—  and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,  so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God—  not the result of works, so that no one may boast.  For we are what he has made us, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life.</p>
