<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>God’s Covenant with Abram</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">After these things the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Abram in a vision, “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.”  But Abram said, “O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”  And Abram said, “You have given me no offspring, and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.”  But the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him, “This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.”  He brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”  And he believed the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> reckoned it to him as righteousness.</p> <p>Then he said to him, “I am the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.”  But he said, “O Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, how am I to know that I shall possess it?”  He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”  He brought him all these and cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.  And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</p>

 <p>Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord’s brother.  In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!  Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,  and I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea that are in Christ;  they only heard it said, “The one who formerly was persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.”  And they glorified God because of me.</p> <h3>Paul and the Other Apostles</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.  I went up in response to a revelation. Then I laid before them (though only in a private meeting with the acknowledged leaders) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure that I was not running, or had not run, in vain.  But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.  But because of false believers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us—  we did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you.  And from those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders (what they actually were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those leaders contributed nothing to me.  On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised  (for he who worked through Peter making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me in sending me to the Gentiles),  and when James and Cephas and John, who were acknowledged pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.  They asked only one thing, that we remember the poor, which was actually what I was eager to do.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->
