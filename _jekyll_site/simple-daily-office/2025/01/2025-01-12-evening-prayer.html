<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Six Days of Creation and the Sabbath</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,  the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.  Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.  And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.  God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p> <p>And God said, “Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”  So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.  God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.</p> <p>And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.  God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.  Then God said, “Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it.” And it was so.  The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.  And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.</p> <p>And God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,  and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.  God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.  God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,  to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.  And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.</p> <p>And God said, “Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.”  So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good.  God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”  And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.</p> <p>And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind.” And it was so.  God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.</p> <p>Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.”</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">So God created humankind in his image,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>in the image of God he created them;</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>male and female he created them.</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.”  God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.  And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.  God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</p> <p class="chapter-1">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.  And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.  So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>God Has Spoken by His Son</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets,  but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the worlds.  He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact imprint of God’s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,  having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p> <h3>The Son Is Superior to Angels</h3>
<p>For to which of the angels did God ever say,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are my Son;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>today I have begotten you”?</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">Or again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“I will be his Father,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and he will be my Son”?</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Let all God’s angels worship him.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Of the angels he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“He makes his angels winds,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and his servants flames of fire.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But of the Son he says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.</span><br>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;<br>therefore God, your God, has anointed you<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">And,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“In the beginning, Lord, you founded the earth,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and the heavens are the work of your hands;</span><br>they will perish, but you remain;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they will all wear out like clothing;</span><br>like a cloak you will roll them up,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and like clothing they will be changed.</span><br>But you are the same,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and your years will never end.”</span></p></div>
