<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.  He journeyed on by stages from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,  to the place where he had made an altar at the first; and there Abram called on the name of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Now Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,  so that the land could not support both of them living together; for their possessions were so great that they could not live together,  and there was strife between the herders of Abram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land.</p> <p>Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herders and my herders; for we are kindred.  Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”  Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere like the garden of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar; this was before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.  So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward; thus they separated from each other.  Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the Plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.  Now the people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Raise your eyes now, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;  for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.  I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.  Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”  So Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p>

 <h3>A Call to Persevere</h3>
<p>Therefore, my friends, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,  by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),  and since we have a great priest over the house of God,  let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.  Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful.  And let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good deeds,  not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</p> <p>For if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,  but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.  Anyone who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”  How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by those who have spurned the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?  For we know the one who said, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.”  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>

Amen.
