<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Rejection of Jesus at Nazareth</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">He left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.  On the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands!  Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.  Then Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.”  And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them.  And he was amazed at their unbelief.</p>
<h3>The Mission of the Twelve</h3>
<p>Then he went about among the villages teaching.  He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.  He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;  but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.  He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.  If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.”  So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent.  They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.</p>

<h3>18. A Song to the Lamb <em class="latin_name">Dignus es</em></h3>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>Splendor and honor and kingly power *</p> <p class="indent">are yours by right, O Lord our God,</p> <p>For you created everything that is, *</p> <p class="indent">and by your will they were created and have their being;</p> <p class="space">And yours by right, O Lamb that was slain, *</p> <p class="indent">for with your blood you have redeemed for God,</p> <p>From every family, language, people, and nation, *</p> <p class="indent">a kingdom of priests to serve our God.</p> <p class="space">And so, to him who sits upon the throne, *</p> <p class="indent">and to Christ the Lamb,</p> <p>Be worship and praise, dominion and splendor, *</p> <p class="indent">for ever and for evermore.</p>

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>

 <p class="indent">He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</p>
 <p class="indent2">and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
 <p class="indent2">was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
 <p class="indent">He descended to the dead.</p>
 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>

by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>

be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
