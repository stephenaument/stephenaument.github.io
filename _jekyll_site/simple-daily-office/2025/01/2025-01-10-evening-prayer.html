<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Restoration after Exile</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply.  I will raise up shepherds over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <h3>The Righteous Branch of David</h3>
<p>The days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.  In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name by which he will be called: “The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is our righteousness.”</p> <p>Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when it shall no longer be said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of Egypt,”  but “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives who brought out and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had driven them.” Then they shall live in their own land.</p>

 <h3>The Message to Sardis</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">“And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars:</p>
<p>“I know your works; you have a name of being alive, but you are dead.  Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God.  Remember then what you received and heard; obey it, and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you.  Yet you have still a few persons in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes; they will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.  If you conquer, you will be clothed like them in white robes, and I will not blot your name out of the book of life; I will confess your name before my Father and before his angels.  Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</p>

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>

We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
and all the blessings of this life;<br>
but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
