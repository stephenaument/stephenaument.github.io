<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made  and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.  Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;  but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.  He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark;  and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.  Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.</p> <p>In the six hundred first year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.  Then God said to Noah,  “Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.  Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”  So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.  And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.</p> <h3>God’s Promise to Noah</h3>
<p>Then Noah built an altar to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.  And when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> smelled the pleasing odor, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.</p> <div class="poetry"><p class="line">As long as the earth endures,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,</span><br>summer and winter, day and night,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>shall not cease.”</span></p></div>

 <h3>Unity in the Body of Christ</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called,  with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,  making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.  There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling,  one Lord, one faith, one baptism,  one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.</p> <p>But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift.  Therefore it is said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>he gave gifts to his people.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">(When it says, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?  He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)  The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,  to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,  until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.  We must no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming.  But speaking the truth in love, we must grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,  from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped, as each part is working properly, promotes the body’s growth in building itself up in love.</p>
