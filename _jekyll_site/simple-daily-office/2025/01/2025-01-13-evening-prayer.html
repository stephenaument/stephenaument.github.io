<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.</p>
<h3>Another Account of the Creation</h3>
<p>In the day that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God made the earth and the heavens,  when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up—for the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;  but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground—  then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.  Out of the ground the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p> <p>A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.  The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;  and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.  The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush.  The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God commanded the man, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.”</p> <p>Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner.”  So out of the ground the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.  The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner.  So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.  And the rib that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.  Then the man said,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“This at last is bone of my bones<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and flesh of my flesh;</span><br>this one shall be called Woman,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for out of Man this one was taken.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.</p>

 <h3>Salutation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,</p>
<p>To the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus:</p> <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <h3>Spiritual Blessings in Christ</h3>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,  just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love.  He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,  to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.  In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace  that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight  he has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ,  as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.  In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will,  so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might live for the praise of his glory.  In him you also, when you had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit;  this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God’s own people, to the praise of his glory.</p>
