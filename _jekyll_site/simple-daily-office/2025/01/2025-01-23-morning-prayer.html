<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <p class="space">Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *</p>
  <p class="indent">and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!</p>

 <h3>A Lamp under a Bushel Basket</h3>
<p>He said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under the bushel basket, or under the bed, and not on the lampstand?  For there is nothing hidden, except to be disclosed; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.  Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”  And he said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you.  For to those who have, more will be given; and from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.”</p> <h3>The Parable of the Growing Seed</h3>
<p>He also said, “The kingdom of God is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground,  and would sleep and rise night and day, and the seed would sprout and grow, he does not know how.  The earth produces of itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.  But when the grain is ripe, at once he goes in with his sickle, because the harvest has come.”</p> <h3>The Parable of the Mustard Seed</h3>
<p>He also said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable will we use for it?  It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;  yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.”</p> <h3>The Use of Parables</h3>
<p>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;  he did not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything in private to his disciples.</p>
