<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>The Tower of Babel</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.  And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.  And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar.  Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.”  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came down to see the city and the tower, which mortals had built.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Look, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.  Come, let us go down, and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”  So the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.  Therefore it was called Babel, because there the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> confused the language of all the earth; and from there the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.</p>

<h3>11. The Third Song of Isaiah <em class="latin_name">Surge, illuminare</em></h3>

<h3>Eph 5:15-33</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise,  making the most of the time, because the days are evil.  So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,  as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts,  giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> <h3>The Christian Household</h3>
<p>Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.</p> <p>Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior.  Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands.</p> <p>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,  in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word,  so as to present the church to himself in splendor, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind—yes, so that she may be holy and without blemish.  In the same way, husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.  For no one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does for the church,  because we are members of his body.  “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”  This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the church.  Each of you, however, should love his wife as himself, and a wife should respect her husband.</p>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
