<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<div class="citation">Jer 37:3-21</div>
<h3>Jer 37:3-21</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah saying, “Please pray for us to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God.”  Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.  Meanwhile, the army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.</p> <p>Then the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to the prophet Jeremiah:  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, God of Israel: This is what the two of you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Pharaoh’s army, which set out to help you, is going to return to its own land, to Egypt.  And the Chaldeans shall return and fight against this city; they shall take it and burn it with fire.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go away.  Even if you defeated the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men in their tents, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.</p> <h3>Jeremiah Is Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Now when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh’s army,  Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his share of property among the people there.  When he reached the Benjamin Gate, a sentinel there named Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah arrested the prophet Jeremiah saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”  And Jeremiah said, “That is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.  The officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of the secretary Jonathan, for it had been made a prison.  Thus Jeremiah was put in the cistern house, in the cells, and remained there many days.</p> <p>Then King Zedekiah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>?” Jeremiah said, “There is!” Then he said, “You shall be handed over to the king of Babylon.”  Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?  Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?  Now please hear me, my lord king: be good enough to listen to my plea, and do not send me back to the house of the secretary Jonathan to die there.”  So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p>

 <p>“A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above the master;  it is enough for the disciple to be like the teacher, and the slave like the master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household!</p> <h3>Whom to Fear</h3>
<p>“So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known.  What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the housetops.  Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.  And even the hairs of your head are all counted.  So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.</p> <p>“Everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven;  but whoever denies me before others, I also will deny before my Father in heaven.</p>
