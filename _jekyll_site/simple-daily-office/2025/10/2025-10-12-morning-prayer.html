<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Scroll Read in the Temple</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.  It may be that when the house of Judah hears of all the disasters that I intend to do to them, all of them may turn from their evil ways, so that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</p> <p>Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he had spoken to him.  And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, “I am prevented from entering the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>;  so you go yourself, and on a fast day in the hearing of the people in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house you shall read the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the people of Judah who come up from their towns.  It may be that their plea will come before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and that all of them will turn from their evil ways, for great is the anger and wrath that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has pronounced against this people.”  And Baruch son of Neriah did all that the prophet Jeremiah ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house.</p> <p>In the fifth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house.</p>

 <h3>A Sinful Woman Forgiven</h3>
<p>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table.  And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment.  She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment.  Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him—that she is a sinner.”  Jesus spoke up and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” “Teacher,” he replied, “speak.”  “A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.  When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?”  Simon answered, “I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.” And Jesus said to him, “You have judged rightly.”  Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.  You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet.  You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.  Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.”  Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”  But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”  And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”</p>
