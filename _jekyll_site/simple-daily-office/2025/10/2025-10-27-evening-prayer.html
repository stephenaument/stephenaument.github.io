<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p class="top-1">John to the seven churches that are in Asia:</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,  and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>I, John, your brother who share with you in Jesus the persecution and the kingdom and the patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.  I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet  saying, “Write in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”</p> <p>Then I turned to see whose voice it was that spoke to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands,  and in the midst of the lampstands I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash across his chest.  His head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire,  his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.  In his right hand he held seven stars, and from his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining with full force.</p> <p>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,  and the living one. I was dead, and see, I am alive forever and ever; and I have the keys of Death and of Hades.  Now write what you have seen, what is, and what is to take place after this.  As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</p>
