<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Hezekiah’s Illness</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.”  Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  “Remember now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I implore you, how I have walked before you in faithfulness with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly.  Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to him:  “Turn back, and say to Hezekiah prince of my people, Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestor David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; indeed, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David’s sake.”  Then Isaiah said, “Bring a lump of figs. Let them take it and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover.”</p> <p>Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> on the third day?”  Isaiah said, “This is the sign to you from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will do the thing that he has promised: the shadow has now advanced ten intervals; shall it retreat ten intervals?”  Hezekiah answered, “It is normal for the shadow to lengthen ten intervals; rather let the shadow retreat ten intervals.”  The prophet Isaiah cried to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>; and he brought the shadow back the ten intervals, by which the sun had declined on the dial of Ahaz.</p> <h3>Envoys from Babylon</h3>
<p>At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.  Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.  Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.”  He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”</p> <p>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”  Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?”</p> <h3>Death of Hezekiah</h3>
<p>The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah, all his power, how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?  Hezekiah slept with his ancestors; and his son Manasseh succeeded him.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Raises the Widow’s Son at Nain</h3>
<p>Soon afterwards he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.  As he approached the gate of the town, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow; and with her was a large crowd from the town.  When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep.”  Then he came forward and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, rise!”  The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.  Fear seized all of them; and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has risen among us!” and “God has looked favorably on his people!”  This word about him spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.</p>

<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
