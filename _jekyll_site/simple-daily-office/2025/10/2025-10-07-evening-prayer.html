<div class="citation">Psalm 139:10, 11</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Abuses at the Lord’s Supper</h3>
<p>Now in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.  For, to begin with, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and to some extent I believe it.  Indeed, there have to be factions among you, for only so will it become clear who among you are genuine.  When you come together, it is not really to eat the Lord’s supper.  For when the time comes to eat, each of you goes ahead with your own supper, and one goes hungry and another becomes drunk.  What! Do you not have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I commend you? In this matter I do not commend you!</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to<br>hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire<br>or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy,<br>forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid,<br>and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy<br>to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus<br>Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
