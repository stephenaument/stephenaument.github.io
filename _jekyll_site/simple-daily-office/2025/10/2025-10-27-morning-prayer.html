<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>First Vision: The Horsemen</h3>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah son of Iddo; and Zechariah said,  In the night I saw a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.  Then I said, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who talked with me said to me, “I will show you what they are.”  So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, “They are those whom the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has sent to patrol the earth.”  Then they spoke to the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and lo, the whole earth remains at peace.”  Then the angel of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which you have been angry these seventy years?”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> replied with gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.  So the angel who talked with me said to me, Proclaim this message: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts; I am very jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.  And I am extremely angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they made the disaster worse.  Therefore, thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; my house shall be built in it, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.  Proclaim further: Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity; the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.</p>

 <h3>The Return of the Unclean Spirit</h3>
<p>“When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless regions looking for a resting place, but it finds none.  Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ When it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order.  Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation.”</p> <h3>The True Kindred of Jesus</h3>
<p>While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.  Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”  But to the one who had told him this, Jesus replied, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”  And pointing to his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!  For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</p>
