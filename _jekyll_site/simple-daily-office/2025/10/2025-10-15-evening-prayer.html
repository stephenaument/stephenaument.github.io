<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

    <p>Help me, L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for there is no godly one left; *</p> <p class="indent">the faithful have vanished from among us.</p> <p class="space">Everyone speaks falsely with his neighbor; *</p> <p class="indent">with a smooth tongue they speak from a double heart.</p> <p class="space">Oh, that the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> would cut off all smooth tongues, *</p> <p class="indent">and close the lips that utter proud boasts!</p> <p class="space">Those who say, "With our tongue will we prevail; *</p> <p class="indent">our lips are our own; who is lord over us?"</p> <p>"Because the needy are oppressed,</p> <p>and the poor cry out in misery, *</p> <p class="indent">I will rise up," says the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>,</p> <p class="indent">"and give them the help they long for."</p> <p>&nbsp;The words of the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> are pure words, *</p> <p class="indent">like silver refined from ore</p> <p class="indent">and purified seven times in the fire.</p> <p class="space">O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, watch over us *</p> <p class="indent">and save us from this generation for ever.</p> <p class="space">The wicked prowl on every side, *</p> <p class="indent">and that which is worthless is highly prized by everyone.</p>

  </p>

    <p>How long, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>?</p> <p>will you forget me for ever? *</p> <p class="indent">how long will you hide your face from me?</p> <p>How long shall I have perplexity in my mind,</p> <p>and grief in my heart, day after day? *</p> <p class="indent">how long shall my enemy triumph over me?</p> <p class="space">Look upon me and answer me, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> my God; *</p> <p class="indent">give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;</p> <p class="space">Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," *</p> <p class="indent">and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.</p> <p class="space">But I put my trust in your mercy; *</p> <p class="indent">my heart is joyful because of your saving help.</p> <p class="space">I will sing to the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for he has dealt with me richly; *</p> <p class="indent">I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.</p>

<h3>1 Cor 14:13-25</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.  For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive.  What should I do then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the mind also; I will sing praise with the spirit, but I will sing praise with the mind also.  Otherwise, if you say a blessing with the spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say the “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since the outsider does not know what you are saying?  For you may give thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.  I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you;  nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p> <p>Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; rather, be infants in evil, but in thinking be adults.  In the law it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“By people of strange tongues<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and by the lips of foreigners</span><br>I will speak to this people;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>yet even then they will not listen to me,”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">says the Lord.  Tongues, then, are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.  If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your mind?  But if all prophesy, an unbeliever or outsider who enters is reproved by all and called to account by all.  After the secrets of the unbeliever’s heart are disclosed, that person will bow down before God and worship him, declaring, “God is really among you.”</p>
