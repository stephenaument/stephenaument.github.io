<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>So the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the prophetess Huldah the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; she resided in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter, where they consulted her.  She declared to them, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me,  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, I will indeed bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants—all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.  Because they have abandoned me and have made offerings to other gods, so that they have provoked me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.  But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,  because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when you heard how I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Therefore, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring on this place.” They took the message back to the king.</p> <h3>Josiah’s Reformation</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Then the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him.  The king went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and with him went all the people of Judah, all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to follow the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant.</p> </div>

 <h3>The Call of Matthew</h3>
<p>As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.</p> <p>And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples.  When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”  But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.  Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”</p> <h3>The Question about Fasting</h3>
<p>Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”  And Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.  No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for the patch pulls away from the cloak, and a worse tear is made.  Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; otherwise, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”</p>
