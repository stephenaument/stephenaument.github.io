<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 22</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Jehoiakim Reigns over Judah</h3>
<p>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.  He did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, just as all his ancestors had done.</p> <h3>Judah Overrun by Enemies</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">In his days King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up; Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.  The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, bands of the Arameans, bands of the Moabites, and bands of the Ammonites; he sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that he spoke by his servants the prophets.  Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, for all that he had committed,  and also for the innocent blood that he had shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not willing to pardon.  Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?  So Jehoiakim slept with his ancestors; then his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.  The king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken over all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Wadi of Egypt to the River Euphrates.</p> <h3>Reign and Captivity of Jehoiachin</h3>
<p>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.  He did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, just as his father had done.</p> <p>At that time the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.  King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it;  King Jehoiachin of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself, his mother, his servants, his officers, and his palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of his reign.</p> <h3>Capture of Jerusalem</h3>
<p>He carried off all the treasures of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the treasures of the king’s house; he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, which King Solomon of Israel had made, all this as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had foretold.  He carried away all Jerusalem, all the officials, all the warriors, ten thousand captives, all the artisans and the smiths; no one remained, except the poorest people of the land.  He carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; the king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officials, and the elite of the land, he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.  The king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, seven thousand, the artisans and the smiths, one thousand, all of them strong and fit for war.  The king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</p> </div>

 <h3>Jesus Heals Two Blind Men</h3>
<p>As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, crying loudly, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”  When he entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”  Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done to you.”  And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly ordered them, “See that no one knows of this.”  But they went away and spread the news about him throughout that district.</p> <h3>Jesus Heals One Who Was Mute</h3>
<p>After they had gone away, a demoniac who was mute was brought to him.  And when the demon had been cast out, the one who had been mute spoke; and the crowds were amazed and said, “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.”  But the Pharisees said, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.”</p>

<p><p>Almighty and everlasting God, you are always more ready to<br>hear than we to pray, and to give more than we either desire<br>or deserve: Pour upon us the abundance of your mercy,<br>forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid,<br>and giving us those good things for which we are not worthy<br>to ask, except through the merits and mediation of Jesus<br>Christ our Savior; who lives and reigns with you and the<br>Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.

<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
