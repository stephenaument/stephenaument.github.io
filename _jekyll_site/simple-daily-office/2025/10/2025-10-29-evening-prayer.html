<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

    <p>The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." *</p><p class="indent">All are corrupt and commit abominable acts;</p><p class="indent">there is none who does any good.</p><p>God looks down from heaven upon us all, *</p><p class="indent">to see if there is any who is wise,</p><p class="indent">if there is one who seeks after God.</p><p class="space">Every one has proved faithless;</p><p>all alike have turned bad; *</p><p class="indent">there is none who does good; no, not one.</p><p class="space">Have they no knowledge, those evildoers *</p><p class="indent">who eat up my people like bread</p><p class="indent">and do not call upon God?</p><p class="space">See how greatly they tremble,</p><p>such trembling as never was; *</p><p class="indent">for God has scattered the bones of the enemy;</p><p class="indent">they are put to shame, because God has rejected them.</p><p class="space">Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come out of Zion! *</p><p class="indent">when God restores the fortunes of his people</p><p class="indent">Jacob will rejoice and Israel be glad.</p>

 <h3>The Scroll and the Lamb</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Then I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals;  and I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”  And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.  And I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.  Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p> <p>Then I saw between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.  He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.  When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.  They sing a new song:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“You are worthy to take the scroll<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and to open its seals,</span><br>for you were slaughtered and by your blood you ransomed for God<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>saints from every tribe and language and people and nation;</span><br>you have made them to be a kingdom and priests serving our God,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and they will reign on earth.”</span></p></div>
