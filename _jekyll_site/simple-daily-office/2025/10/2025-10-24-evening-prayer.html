<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord just as I am;  therefore let no one despise him. Send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I am expecting him with the brothers.</p> <p>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not at all willing to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity.</p> <h3>Final Messages and Greetings</h3>
<p>Keep alert, stand firm in your faith, be courageous, be strong.  Let all that you do be done in love.</p> <p>Now, brothers and sisters, you know that members of the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints;  I urge you to put yourselves at the service of such people, and of everyone who works and toils with them.  I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence;  for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such persons.</p> <p>The churches of Asia send greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, greet you warmly in the Lord.  All the brothers and sisters send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p> <p class="top-1">I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.  Let anyone be accursed who has no love for the Lord. Our Lord, come!  The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.  My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.</p>
