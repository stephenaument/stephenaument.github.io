<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<h3>Jonah 3:1-4:11</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Conversion of Nineveh</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Jonah a second time, saying,  “Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.”  So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days’ walk across.  Jonah began to go into the city, going a day’s walk. And he cried out, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”  And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.</p> <p>When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  Then he had a proclamation made in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: No human being or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything. They shall not feed, nor shall they drink water.  Human beings and animals shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry mightily to God. All shall turn from their evil ways and from the violence that is in their hands.  Who knows? God may relent and change his mind; he may turn from his fierce anger, so that we do not perish.”</p> <p>When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.</p> <h3>Jonah’s Anger</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">But this was very displeasing to Jonah, and he became angry.  He prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>! Is not this what I said while I was still in my own country? That is why I fled to Tarshish at the beginning; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and ready to relent from punishing.  And now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”  Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down east of the city, and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would become of the city.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God appointed a bush, and made it come up over Jonah, to give shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort; so Jonah was very happy about the bush.  But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the bush, so that it withered.  When the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint and asked that he might die. He said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”</p> <h3>Jonah Is Reproved</h3>
<p>But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the bush?” And he said, “Yes, angry enough to die.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labor and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.  And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

 <h3>Orderly Worship</h3>
<p>What should be done then, my friends? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.  If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret.  But if there is no one to interpret, let them be silent in church and speak to themselves and to God.  Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.  If a revelation is made to someone else sitting nearby, let the first person be silent.  For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.  And the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,  for God is a God not of disorder but of peace.</p>

 <p>Anyone who claims to be a prophet, or to have spiritual powers, must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.  Anyone who does not recognize this is not to be recognized.  So, my friends, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues;  but all things should be done decently and in order.</p>
