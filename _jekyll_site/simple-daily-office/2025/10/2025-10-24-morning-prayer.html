<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of Proper 24</h3>


<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Worship Restored at Jerusalem</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When the seventh month came, and the Israelites were in the towns, the people gathered together in Jerusalem.  Then Jeshua son of Jozadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his kin set out to build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as prescribed in the law of Moses the man of God.  They set up the altar on its foundation, because they were in dread of the neighboring peoples, and they offered burnt offerings upon it to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, morning and evening.  And they kept the festival of booths, as prescribed, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as required for each day,  and after that the regular burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the sacred festivals of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. But the foundation of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not yet laid.  So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from King Cyrus of Persia.</p> <h3>Foundation Laid for the Temple</h3>
<p>In the second year after their arrival at the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their people, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work on the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And Jeshua with his sons and his kin, and Kadmiel and his sons, Binnui and Hodaviah along with the sons of Henadad, the Levites, their sons and kin, together took charge of the workers in the house of God.</p> <p>When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the priests in their vestments were stationed to praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, according to the directions of King David of Israel;  and they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“For he is good,<br>for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel.”</p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">And all the people responded with a great shout when they praised the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, because the foundation of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was laid.  But many of the priests and Levites and heads of families, old people who had seen the first house on its foundations, wept with a loud voice when they saw this house, though many shouted aloud for joy,  so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people shouted so loudly that the sound was heard far away.</p>

 <h3>Jesus and Beelzebul</h3>
<p>Then they brought to him a demoniac who was blind and mute; and he cured him, so that the one who had been mute could speak and see.  All the crowds were amazed and said, “Can this be the Son of David?”  But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that this fellow casts out the demons.”  He knew what they were thinking and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.  If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?  If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own exorcists cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.  But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.  Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property, without first tying up the strong man? Then indeed the house can be plundered.  Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.  Therefore I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.  Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</p>
