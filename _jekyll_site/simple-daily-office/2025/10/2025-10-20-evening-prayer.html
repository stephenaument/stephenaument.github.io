<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>And why are we putting ourselves in danger every hour?  I die every day! That is as certain, brothers and sisters, as my boasting of you—a boast that I make in Christ Jesus our Lord.  If with merely human hopes I fought with wild animals at Ephesus, what would I have gained by it? If the dead are not raised,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Let us eat and drink,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>for tomorrow we die.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Do not be deceived:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Bad company ruins good morals.”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">Come to a sober and right mind, and sin no more; for some people have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</p> <h3>The Resurrection Body</h3>
<p>But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”  Fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.  And as for what you sow, you do not sow the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.  But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.  Not all flesh is alike, but there is one flesh for human beings, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.  There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is another.  There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; indeed, star differs from star in glory.</p>
