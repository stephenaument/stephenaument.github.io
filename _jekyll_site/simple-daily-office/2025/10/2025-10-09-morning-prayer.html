<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>The king commanded the high priest Hilkiah, the priests of the second order, and the guardians of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.  He deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who made offerings to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and all the host of the heavens.  He brought out the image of Asherah from the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, outside Jerusalem, to the Wadi Kidron, burned it at the Wadi Kidron, beat it to dust and threw the dust of it upon the graves of the common people.  He broke down the houses of the male temple prostitutes that were in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, where the women did weaving for Asherah.  He brought all the priests out of the towns of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings, from Geba to Beer-sheba; he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on the left at the gate of the city.  The priests of the high places, however, did not come up to the altar of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Jerusalem, but ate unleavened bread among their kindred.  He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, so that no one would make a son or a daughter pass through fire as an offering to Molech.  He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, by the chamber of the eunuch Nathan-melech, which was in the precincts; then he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.  The altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, he pulled down from there and broke in pieces, and threw the rubble into the Wadi Kidron.  The king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Destruction, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.  He broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the sacred poles, and covered the sites with human bones.</p> <p>Moreover, the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin—he pulled down that altar along with the high place. He burned the high place, crushing it to dust; he also burned the sacred pole.  As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mount; and he sent and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> that the man of God proclaimed, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the festival; he turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God who had predicted these things.  Then he said, “What is that monument that I see?” The people of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel.”  He said, “Let him rest; let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.  Moreover, Josiah removed all the shrines of the high places that were in the towns of Samaria, which kings of Israel had made, provoking the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to anger; he did to them just as he had done at Bethel.  He slaughtered on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.</p> <h3>The Passover Celebrated</h3>
<p>The king commanded all the people, “Keep the passover to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God as prescribed in this book of the covenant.”  No such passover had been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel, even during all the days of the kings of Israel and of the kings of Judah;  but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this passover was kept to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> in Jerusalem.</p> <p>Moreover Josiah put away the mediums, wizards, teraphim, idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he established the words of the law that were written in the book that the priest Hilkiah had found in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Before him there was no king like him, who turned to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.</p>

 <h3>A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</h3>
<p>While he was saying these things to them, suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”  And Jesus got up and followed him, with his disciples.  Then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak,  for she said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be made well.”  Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well.  When Jesus came to the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,  he said, “Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him.  But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.  And the report of this spread throughout that district.</p>
