<div class="citation">John 4:23</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Hezekiah Consults Isaiah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">When King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.  They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.  It may be that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God heard all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.”  When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,  Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have reviled me.  I myself will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.’”</p> <h3>Sennacherib’s Threat</h3>
<p>The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah; for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.  When the king heard concerning King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, “See, he has set out to fight against you,” he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,  “Thus shall you speak to King Hezekiah of Judah: Do not let your God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.  See, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them utterly. Shall you be delivered?  Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my predecessors destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?  Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?”</p> <h3>Hezekiah’s Prayer</h3>
<p>Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; then Hezekiah went up to the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and spread it before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  And Hezekiah prayed before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and said: “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> the God of Israel, who are enthroned above the cherubim, you are God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.  Incline your ear, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and hear; open your eyes, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and see; hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.  Truly, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,  and have hurled their gods into the fire, though they were no gods but the work of human hands—wood and stone—and so they were destroyed.  So now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God, save us, I pray you, from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, are God alone.”</p> <p>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria.  </p>

  <p>Seek the Lord while he wills to be found; *</p> <p class="indent">call upon him when he draws near.</p> <p>Let the wicked forsake their ways *</p> <p class="indent">and the evil ones their thoughts;</p> <p>And let them turn to the Lord, and he will have compassion, *</p> <p class="indent">and to our God, for he will richly pardon.</p> <p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, *</p> <p class="indent">nor your ways my ways, says the Lord.</p> <p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, *</p> <p class="indent">so are my ways higher than your ways,</p> <p class="indent">and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> <p>For as rain and snow fall from the heavens *</p> <p class="indent">and return not again, but water the earth,</p> <p>Bringing forth life and giving growth, *</p> <p class="indent">seed for sowing and bread for eating,</p> <p>So is my word that goes forth from my mouth; *</p> <p class="indent">it will not return to me empty;</p> <p>But it will accomplish that which I have purposed, *</p> <p class="indent">and prosper in that for which I sent it.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

 <h3>Jesus Cleanses a Leper</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">When Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him;  and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean.”  He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I do choose. Be made clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  Then Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</p> <h3>Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant</h3>
<p>When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, appealing to him  and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress.”  And he said to him, “I will come and cure him.”  The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my servant will be healed.  For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and the slave does it.”  When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith.  I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,  while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”  And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go; let it be done for you according to your faith.” And the servant was healed in that hour.</p> <h3>Jesus Heals Many at Peter’s House</h3>
<p>When Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever;  he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.  That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were sick.  This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.”</p>
