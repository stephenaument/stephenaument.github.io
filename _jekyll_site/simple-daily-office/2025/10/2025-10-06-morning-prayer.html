<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Manasseh Reigns over Judah</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.  He did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, following the abominable practices of the nations that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> drove out before the people of Israel.  For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.  He built altars in the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had said, “In Jerusalem I will put my name.”  He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, provoking him to anger.  The carved image of Asherah that he had made he set in the house of which the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to David and to his son Solomon, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever;  I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land that I gave to their ancestors, if only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.”  But they did not listen; Manasseh misled them to do more evil than the nations had done that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> destroyed before the people of Israel.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said by his servants the prophets,  “Because King Manasseh of Judah has committed these abominations, has done things more wicked than all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and has caused Judah also to sin with his idols;  therefore thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such evil that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.  I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line for Samaria, and the plummet for the house of Ahab; I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.  I will cast off the remnant of my heritage, and give them into the hand of their enemies; they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,  because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, even to this day.”</p> <p>Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin that he caused Judah to sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.</p> <p>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?  Manasseh slept with his ancestors, and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza. His son Amon succeeded him.</p>

 <h3>Jesus Heals the Gadarene Demoniacs</h3>
<p>When he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him. They were so fierce that no one could pass that way.  Suddenly they shouted, “What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”  Now a large herd of swine was feeding at some distance from them.  The demons begged him, “If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.”  And he said to them, “Go!” So they came out and entered the swine; and suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the water.  The swineherds ran off, and on going into the town, they told the whole story about what had happened to the demoniacs.  Then the whole town came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.  </p>
