<h3 class="title">Monday In The Week Of 3 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">Daniel 9:9,10</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, because we have rebelled against him and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by following his laws which he set before us.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Jeremiah Proclaims God’s Judgment on the Nation</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>:  Stand in the gate of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, all you people of Judah, you that enter these gates to worship the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Thus says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your doings, and let me dwell with you in this place.  Do not trust in these deceptive words: “This is the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the temple of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p> <p>For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly act justly one with another,  if you do not oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt,  then I will dwell with you in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your ancestors forever and ever.</p> <p>Here you are, trusting in deceptive words to no avail.  Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known,  and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, “We are safe!”—only to go on doing all these abominations?  Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your sight? You know, I too am watching, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.  Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.  And now, because you have done all these things, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer,  therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh.  And I will cast you out of my sight, just as I cast out all your kinsfolk, all the offspring of Ephraim.</p>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>About the middle of the festival Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.  The Jews were astonished at it, saying, “How does this man have such learning, when he has never been taught?”  Then Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.  Anyone who resolves to do the will of God will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.  Those who speak on their own seek their own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and there is nothing false in him.</p> <p>“Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you looking for an opportunity to kill me?”  The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you?”  Jesus answered them, “I performed one work, and all of you are astonished.  Moses gave you circumcision (it is, of course, not from Moses, but from the patriarchs), and you circumcise a man on the sabbath.  If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath in order that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I healed a man’s whole body on the sabbath?  Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”</p> <h3>Is This the Christ?</h3>
<p>Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is not this the man whom they are trying to kill?  And here he is, speaking openly, but they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Messiah?  Yet we know where this man is from; but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.”  Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple, “You know me, and you know where I am from. I have not come on my own. But the one who sent me is true, and you do not know him.  I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”  Then they tried to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.  Yet many in the crowd believed in him and were saying, “When the Messiah comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?”</p> <h3>Officers Are Sent to Arrest Jesus</h3>
<p>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering such things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent temple police to arrest him.  Jesus then said, “I will be with you a little while longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.  You will search for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.”  The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?  What does he mean by saying, ‘You will search for me and you will not find me’ and ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?”</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O ruler of the universe, Lord God,</p> <p>great deeds are they that you have done, *</p> <p class="indent">surpassing human understanding.</p> <p>Your ways are ways of righteousness and truth, *</p> <p class="indent">O King of all the ages.</p> <p class="space">Who can fail to do you homage, Lord,</p> <p>and sing the praises of your Name? *</p> <p class="indent">for you only are the Holy One.</p> <p>All nations will draw near and fall down before you, *</p> <p class="indent">because your just and holy works have been revealed.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

<p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</p>

<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>

 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
