<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Moses Commands Obedience</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">So now, Israel, give heed to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching you to observe, so that you may live to enter and occupy the land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.  You must neither add anything to what I command you nor take away anything from it, but keep the commandments of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God with which I am charging you.  You have seen for yourselves what the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> did with regard to the Baal of Peor—how the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,  while those of you who held fast to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God are all alive today.</p> <p>See, just as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God has charged me, I now teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.  You must observe them diligently, for this will show your wisdom and discernment to the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people!”  For what other great nation has a god so near to it as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God is whenever we call to him?  And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am setting before you today?</p> <p>But take care and watch yourselves closely, so as neither to forget the things that your eyes have seen nor to let them slip from your mind all the days of your life; make them known to your children and your children’s children—  </p>

 <h3>Mary Anoints Jesus</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.  There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.  Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus’ feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.  But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said,  “Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”  (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.)  Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.  You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”</p>
