<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

  <p>Surely, it is God who saves me; *</p> <p class="indent">I will trust in him and not be afraid.</p> <p>For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *</p> <p class="indent">and he will be my Savior.</p> <p>Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *</p> <p class="indent">from the springs of salvation.</p> <p>And on that day you shall say, *</p> <p class="indent">Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;</p> <p>Make his deeds known among the peoples; *</p> <p class="indent">see that they remember that his Name is exalted.</p> <p>Sing the praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *</p> <p class="indent">and this is known in all the world.</p> <p>Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *</p> <p class="indent">for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.

<h3>2 Cor 4:13-5:10</h3>

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>But just as we have the same spirit of faith that is in accordance with scripture—“I believed, and so I spoke”—we also believe, and so we speak,  because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will bring us with you into his presence.  Yes, everything is for your sake, so that grace, as it extends to more and more people, may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p> <h3>Living by Faith</h3>
<p>So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day.  For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure,  because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.</p> <p class="chapter-1">For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—  if indeed, when we have taken it off we will not be found naked.  For while we are still in this tent, we groan under our burden, because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.  He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</p> <p>So we are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord—  for we walk by faith, not by sight.  Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.  So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.  For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>O Lord, you have taught us that without love whatever we<br>do is worth nothing; Send your Holy Spirit and pour into our<br>hearts your greatest gift, which is love, the true bond of peace<br>and of all virtue, without which whoever lives is accounted<br>dead before you.

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.
</p>

Amen.
