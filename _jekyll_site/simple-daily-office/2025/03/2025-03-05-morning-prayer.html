<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<h3>Jonah 3:1-4:11</h3>

<p class="lesson">
  <div class="passage-text">
<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <h3>Conversion of Nineveh</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">The word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> came to Jonah a second time, saying,  “Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.”  So Jonah set out and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days’ walk across.  Jonah began to go into the city, going a day’s walk. And he cried out, “Forty days more, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”  And the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast, and everyone, great and small, put on sackcloth.</p> <p>When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.  Then he had a proclamation made in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: No human being or animal, no herd or flock, shall taste anything. They shall not feed, nor shall they drink water.  Human beings and animals shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry mightily to God. All shall turn from their evil ways and from the violence that is in their hands.  Who knows? God may relent and change his mind; he may turn from his fierce anger, so that we do not perish.”</p> <p>When God saw what they did, how they turned from their evil ways, God changed his mind about the calamity that he had said he would bring upon them; and he did not do it.</p> <h3>Jonah’s Anger</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">But this was very displeasing to Jonah, and he became angry.  He prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>! Is not this what I said while I was still in my own country? That is why I fled to Tarshish at the beginning; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and ready to relent from punishing.  And now, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.”  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “Is it right for you to be angry?”  Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down east of the city, and made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would become of the city.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> God appointed a bush, and made it come up over Jonah, to give shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort; so Jonah was very happy about the bush.  But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the bush, so that it withered.  When the sun rose, God prepared a sultry east wind, and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he was faint and asked that he might die. He said, “It is better for me to die than to live.”</p> <h3>Jonah Is Reproved</h3>
<p>But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the bush?” And he said, “Yes, angry enough to die.”  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said, “You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labor and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.  And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?”</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h3>
<p>He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and regarded others with contempt:  “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.  The Pharisee, standing by himself, was praying thus, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: thieves, rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.  I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all my income.’  But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even look up to heaven, but was beating his breast and saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’  I tell you, this man went down to his home justified rather than the other; for all who exalt themselves will be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted.”</p>
