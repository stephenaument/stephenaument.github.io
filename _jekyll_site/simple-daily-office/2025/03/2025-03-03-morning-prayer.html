<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>But take care and watch yourselves closely, so as neither to forget the things that your eyes have seen nor to let them slip from your mind all the days of your life; make them known to your children and your children’s children—  how you once stood before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God at Horeb, when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Assemble the people for me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me as long as they live on the earth, and may teach their children so”;  you approached and stood at the foot of the mountain while the mountain was blazing up to the very heavens, shrouded in dark clouds.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.  He declared to you his covenant, which he charged you to observe, that is, the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two stone tablets.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> charged me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy.</p>
