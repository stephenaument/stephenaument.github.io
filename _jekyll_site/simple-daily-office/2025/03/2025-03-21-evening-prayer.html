<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:  if you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here where you are imprisoned. The rest of you shall go and carry grain for the famine of your households,  and bring your youngest brother to me. Thus your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they agreed to do so.  They said to one another, “Alas, we are paying the penalty for what we did to our brother; we saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this anguish has come upon us.”  Then Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not to wrong the boy? But you would not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.”  They did not know that Joseph understood them, since he spoke with them through an interpreter.  He turned away from them and wept; then he returned and spoke to them. And he picked out Simeon and had him bound before their eyes.  Joseph then gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return every man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This was done for them.</p> <h3>Joseph’s Brothers Return to Canaan</h3>
<p>They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed.  When one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money at the top of the sack.  He said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in my sack!” At this they lost heart and turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”</p>

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.  So, if those who are uncircumcised keep the requirements of the law, will not their uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?  Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will condemn you that have the written code and circumcision but break the law.  For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical.  Rather, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart—it is spiritual and not literal. Such a person receives praise not from others but from God.</p> <p class="chapter-1">Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?  Much, in every way. For in the first place the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.  What if some were unfaithful? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?  By no means! Although everyone is a liar, let God be proved true, as it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“So that you may be justified in your words,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and prevail in your judging.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">But if our injustice serves to confirm the justice of God, what should we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)  By no means! For then how could God judge the world?  But if through my falsehood God’s truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?  And why not say (as some people slander us by saying that we say), “Let us do evil so that good may come”? Their condemnation is deserved!</p> <h3>None Is Righteous</h3>
<p>What then? Are we any better off? No, not at all; for we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin,  as it is written:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“There is no one who is righteous, not even one;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there is no one who has understanding,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>there is no one who seeks God.</span><br>All have turned aside, together they have become worthless;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>there is no one who shows kindness,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>there is not even one.”</span><br>“Their throats are opened graves;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>they use their tongues to deceive.”</span><br>“The venom of vipers is under their lips.”<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”</span><br>“Their feet are swift to shed blood;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>ruin and misery are in their paths,</span><br>and the way of peace they have not known.”<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</span></p></div>  <!--end of footnotes-->
