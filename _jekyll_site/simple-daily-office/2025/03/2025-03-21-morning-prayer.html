<h3 class="title">Friday In The Week Of 2 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">1 John 1:8-9</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, but if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

    <p>Save me, O God, *</p><p class="indent">for the waters have risen up to my neck.</p><p class="space">I am sinking in deep mire, *</p><p class="indent">and there is no firm ground for my feet.</p><p class="space">I have come into deep waters, *</p><p class="indent">and the torrent washes over me.</p><p class="space">I have grown weary with my crying;</p><p>my throat is inflamed; *</p><p class="indent">my eyes have failed from looking for my God.</p><p class="space">Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;</p><p>my lying foes who would destroy me are mighty. *</p><p class="indent">Must I then give back what I never stole?</p><p class="space">O God, you know my foolishness, *</p><p class="indent">and my faults are not hidden from you.</p><p class="space">Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, Lord GOD of hosts; *</p><p class="indent">let not those who seek you be disgraced because of me, O God of Israel.</p><p>Surely, for your sake have I suffered reproach, *</p><p class="indent">and shame has covered my face.</p><p class="space">I have become a stranger to my own kindred, *</p><p class="indent">an alien to my mother's children.</p><p class="space">Zeal for your house has eaten me up; *</p><p class="indent">the scorn of those who scorn you has fallen upon me.</p><p class="space">I humbled myself with fasting, *</p><p class="indent">but that was turned to my reproach.</p><p class="space">I put on sack-cloth also, *</p><p class="indent">and became a byword among them.</p><p class="space">Those who sit at the gate murmur against me, *</p><p class="indent">and the drunkards make songs about me.</p><p class="space">But as for me, this is my prayer to you, *</p><p class="indent">at the time you have set, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>:</p><p class="space">"In your great mercy, O God, *</p><p class="indent">answer me with your unfailing help.</p><p class="space">Save me from the mire;

*</p><p class="indent">do not let the Pit shut its mouth upon me.</p><p class="space">Answer me, O L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span>, for your love is kind; *</p><p class="indent">in your great compassion, turn to me."</p><p>"Hide not your face from your servant;

*</p><p class="indent">your help, O God, will lift me up on high.</p><p class="space">I will praise the Name of God in song; *</p><p class="indent">I will proclaim his greatness with thanksgiving.</p><p class="space">This will please the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> more than an offering of oxen, *</p><p class="indent">more than bullocks with horns and hoofs.</p><p>The afflicted shall see and be glad; *</p><p class="indent">you who seek God, your heart shall live.</p><p class="space">For the L<span style="font-size: small">ORD</span> listens to the needy, *</p><p class="indent">and his prisoners he does not despise.</p><p class="space">Let the heavens and the earth praise him, *</p><p class="indent">the seas and all that moves in them;</p><p class="space">For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; *</p><p class="indent">they shall live there and have it in possession.</p><p class="space">The children of his servants will inherit it, *</p><p class="indent">and those who love his Name will dwell therein.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <p>O Lord and Ruler of the hosts of heaven, * <p class="indent">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, <p class="indent">and of all their righteous offspring: <p>You made the heavens and the earth, * <p class="indent">with all their vast array. <p>All things quake with fear at your presence; * <p class="indent">they tremble because of your power. <p>But your merciful promise is beyond all measure; * <p class="indent">it surpasses all that our minds can fathom. <p>O Lord, you are full of compassion, * <p class="indent">long-suffering, and abounding in mercy. <p>You hold back your hand; * <p class="indent">you do not punish as we deserve. <p>In your great goodness, Lord, <p>you have promised forgiveness to sinners, * <p class="indent">that they may repent of their sin and be saved. <p>And now, O Lord, I bend the knee of my heart, * <p class="indent">and make my appeal, sure of your gracious goodness. <p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, * <p class="indent">and I know my wickedness only too well. <p>Therefore I make this prayer to you: * <p class="indent">Forgive me, Lord, forgive me. <p>Do not let me perish in my sin, * <p class="indent">nor condemn me to the depths of the earth. <p>For you, O Lord, are the God of those who repent, * <p class="indent">and in me you will show forth your goodness. <p>Unworthy as I am, you will save me, <p>in accordance with your great mercy, * <p class="indent">and I will praise you without ceasing all the days of my life. <p>For all the powers of heaven sing your praises, * <p class="indent">and yours is the glory to ages of ages.

 <h3>Witnesses to Jesus</h3>
<p>“I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</p> <p>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.  There is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that his testimony to me is true.  You sent messengers to John, and he testified to the truth.  Not that I accept such human testimony, but I say these things so that you may be saved.  He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.  But I have a testimony greater than John’s. The works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.  And the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his form,  and you do not have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe him whom he has sent.</p> <p>“You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that testify on my behalf.  Yet you refuse to come to me to have life.  I do not accept glory from human beings.  But I know that you do not have the love of God in you.  I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; if another comes in his own name, you will accept him.  How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is God?  Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope.  If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.  But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”</p>
