<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Dreams of Two Prisoners</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.  Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,  and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.  The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody.  One night they both dreamed—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning.  When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.  So he asked Pharaoh’s officers, who were with him in custody in his master’s house, “Why are your faces downcast today?”  They said to him, “We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.”</p> <p>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me,  and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and the clusters ripened into grapes.  Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”  Then Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;  within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.  But remember me when it is well with you; please do me the kindness to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this place.  For in fact I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon.”</p> <p>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,  and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.”  And Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;  within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head—from you!—and hang you on a pole; and the birds will eat the flesh from you.”</p> <p>On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.  He restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand;  but the chief baker he hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.  Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</p>

<p> For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ.  Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—  the work of each builder will become visible, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each has done.  If what has been built on the foundation survives, the builder will receive a reward.  If the work is burned up, the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as through fire.</p> <p>Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?  If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.</p> <p>Do not deceive yourselves. If you think that you are wise in this age, you should become fools so that you may become wise.  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“He catches the wise in their craftiness,”</p></div> <p class="first-line-none">and again,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>that they are futile.”</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">So let no one boast about human leaders. For all things are yours,  whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all belong to you,  and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</p>
