<div class="citation">Amos 5:8</div>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <p>Then I turned to the Lord God, to seek an answer by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.  I prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> my God and made confession, saying,</p>
<p>“Ah, Lord, great and awesome God, keeping covenant and steadfast love with those who love you and keep your commandments,  we have sinned and done wrong, acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and ordinances.  We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our ancestors, and to all the people of the land.</p> <p>“Righteousness is on your side, O Lord, but open shame, as at this day, falls on us, the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those who are near and those who are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery that they have committed against you.  Open shame, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, falls on us, our kings, our officials, and our ancestors, because we have sinned against you.

 <h3>Moses a Servant, Christ a Son</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">Therefore, brothers and sisters, holy partners in a heavenly calling, consider that Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,  was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also “was faithful in all God’s house.”  Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.  (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)  Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken later.  Christ, however, was faithful over God’s house as a son, and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope.</p> <h3>Warning against Unbelief</h3>
<p>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“Today, if you hear his voice,<br>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>as on the day of testing in the wilderness,</span><br>where your ancestors put me to the test,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>though they had seen my works  for forty years.</span><br>Therefore I was angry with that generation,<br>and I said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>and they have not known my ways.’</span><br>As in my anger I swore,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>‘They will not enter my rest.’”</span></p></div>

<h3>15. The Song of Mary <em class="latin_name">Magnificat</em></h3>

  <p>My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,</p> <p>my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *</p> <p class="indent">for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.</p> <p>From this day all generations will call me blessed: *</p> <p class="indent">the Almighty has done great things for me,</p> <p class="indent">and holy is his Name.</p> <p>He has mercy on those who fear him *</p> <p class="indent">in every generation.</p> <p>He has shown the strength of his arm, *</p> <p class="indent">he has scattered the proud in their conceit.</p> <p>He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *</p> <p class="indent">and has lifted up the lowly.</p> <p>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</p> <p class="indent">and the rich he has sent away empty.</p> <p>He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *</p> <p class="indent">for he has remembered his promise of mercy,</p> <p>The promise he made to our fathers, *</p> <p class="indent">to Abraham and his children for ever.</p> <p class="space">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *</p> <p class="indent">as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.
