<h3 class="title">Mar 25 The Annunciation Of Our Lord Jesus Christ To Mary</h3>


<div class="citation">Mark 8:34</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">Jesus said, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <h3>Exaltation through Abasement</h3>
<p>Now God did not subject the coming world, about which we are speaking, to angels.  But someone has testified somewhere,</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">“What are human beings that you are mindful of them,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>or mortals, that you care for them?</span><br>You have made them for a little while lower than the angels;<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>you have crowned them with glory and honor,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>subjecting all things under their feet.”</span></p></div>
<p class="first-line-none">Now in subjecting all things to them, God left nothing outside their control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to them,  but we do see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p> <p>It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  </p>

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. Amen.

<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.
