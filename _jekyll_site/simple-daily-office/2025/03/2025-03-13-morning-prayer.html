<h3 class="date">March 13, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Thursday In The Week Of 1 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">Luke 15:18,19</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.”</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

<div class="passage-content passage-class-0">
<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
<p> And when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and occupy the land that I have given you,” you rebelled against the command of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God, neither trusting him nor obeying him.  You have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> as long as he has known you.</p> <p>Throughout the forty days and forty nights that I lay prostrate before the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> intended to destroy you,  I prayed to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> and said, “Lord <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, do not destroy the people who are your very own possession, whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.  Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin,  otherwise the land from which you have brought us might say, ‘Because the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to let them die in the wilderness.’  For they are the people of your very own possession, whom you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.”</p> <h3>The Second Pair of Tablets</h3>
<p class="chapter-2">At that time the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the former ones, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood.  I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you smashed, and you shall put them in the ark.”  So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.  Then he wrote on the tablets the same words as before, the ten commandments that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave them to me.  So I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark that I had made; and there they are, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> commanded me.</p>  <!--end of footnotes-->

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.</p> <p>“Indeed, God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.  Those who believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.  For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may not be exposed.  But those who do what is true come to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God.”</p>
