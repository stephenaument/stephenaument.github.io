<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>The Marriage of Boaz and Ruth</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">No sooner had Boaz gone up to the gate and sat down there than the next-of-kin, of whom Boaz had spoken, came passing by. So Boaz said, “Come over, friend; sit down here.” And he went over and sat down.  Then Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here”; so they sat down.  He then said to the next-of-kin, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our kinsman Elimelech.  So I thought I would tell you of it, and say: Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, so that I may know; for there is no one prior to you to redeem it, and I come after you.” So he said, “I will redeem it.”  Then Boaz said, “The day you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you are also acquiring Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead man, to maintain the dead man’s name on his inheritance.”  At this, the next-of-kin said, “I cannot redeem it for myself without damaging my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”</p> <p>Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one took off a sandal and gave it to the other; this was the manner of attesting in Israel.  So when the next-of-kin said to Boaz, “Acquire it for yourself,” he took off his sandal.  Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have acquired from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon.  I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, to maintain the dead man’s name on his inheritance, in order that the name of the dead may not be cut off from his kindred and from the gate of his native place; today you are witnesses.”  Then all the people who were at the gate, along with the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you produce children in Ephrathah and bestow a name in Bethlehem;  and, through the children that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> will give you by this young woman, may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”</p> <h3>The Genealogy of David</h3>
<p>So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When they came together, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made her conceive, and she bore a son.  Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who has not left you this day without next-of-kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel!  He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him.”  Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse.  The women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed; he became the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>

 <h3>Concerning Almsgiving</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">“Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.</p> <p>“So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.  But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,  so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p> <h3>Concerning Prayer</h3>
<p>“And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.  But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p> <p>“When you are praying, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.  Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</p> <p>“Pray then in this way:</p>
<div class="poetry"><p class="line">Our Father in heaven,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>hallowed be your name.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Your kingdom come.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Your will be done,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>on earth as it is in heaven.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Give us this day our daily bread.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>And forgive us our debts,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>as we also have forgiven our debtors.</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>And do not bring us to the time of trial,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">        </span>but rescue us from the evil one.</span></p></div> <p class="first-line-none">For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;  but if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p> <h3>Concerning Fasting</h3>
<p>“And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.  </p>
