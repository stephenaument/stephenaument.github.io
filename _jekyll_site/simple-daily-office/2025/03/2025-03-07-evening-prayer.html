<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dear friends in Christ, here in the presence of Almighty God, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, so that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

 <h3>Teach Sound Doctrine</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">But as for you, teach what is consistent with sound doctrine.  Tell the older men to be temperate, serious, prudent, and sound in faith, in love, and in endurance.</p> <p>Likewise, tell the older women to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good,  so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,  to be self-controlled, chaste, good managers of the household, kind, being submissive to their husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited.</p> <p>Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.  Show yourself in all respects a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity,  and sound speech that cannot be censured; then any opponent will be put to shame, having nothing evil to say of us.</p> <p>Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to talk back,  not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior.</p> <p>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all,  training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly,  while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.  He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.</p> <p>Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one look down on you.</p>

<h3>The Apostles Creed</h3>

 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>
 <p class="indent">the forgiveness of sins,</p>
 <p class="indent">the resurrection of the body,</p>

<h3>The Collect of the Day</h3>
<p><p>Almighty and everlasting God, you hate nothing you have<br>made and forgive the sins of all who are penitent: Create and<br>make in us new and contrite hearts, that we, worthily<br>lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness,<br>may obtain of you, the God of all mercy, perfect remission<br>and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives<br>and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever<br>and ever. <em>Amen.</em> </p></p>

<h3>A Collect for Fridays</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away the sting of death: Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep peacefully in you and wake up in your likeness; for your tender mercies’ sake. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Mission</h3>
<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love’s sake. Amen.
</p>


<h3>A Prayer of St. Chrysostom</h3>
  
<p>
  
  Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplication to you; and you have promised through your well-beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his Name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. Amen.
</p>

Let us bless the Lord<br>
Thanks be to God.
