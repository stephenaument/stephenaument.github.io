<h3 class="date">March 31, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Monday In The Week Of 4 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">1 John 1:8-9</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, but if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <p>And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, “Why has the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> our God?”  then you shall say to them: It is because your ancestors have forsaken me, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law;  and because you have behaved worse than your ancestors, for here you are, every one of you, following your stubborn evil will, refusing to listen to me.  Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.</p> <h3>God Will Restore Israel</h3>
<p>Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, when it shall no longer be said, “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of Egypt,”  but “As the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> lives who brought the people of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the lands where he had driven them.” For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their ancestors.</p> <p>I am now sending for many fishermen, says the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, and they shall catch them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.  For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my presence, nor is their iniquity concealed from my sight.  And I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</p> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line">O <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>, my strength and my stronghold,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>my refuge in the day of trouble,</span><br>to you shall the nations come<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>from the ends of the earth and say:</span><br>Our ancestors have inherited nothing but lies,<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>worthless things in which there is no profit.</span><br>Can mortals make for themselves gods?<br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">    </span>Such are no gods!</span></p></div> <p class="top-1">“Therefore I am surely going to teach them, this time I am going to teach them my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span>.”</p>

 <h3>Feeding the Five Thousand</h3>
<p class="chapter-1">After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.   A large crowd kept following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing for the sick.  Jesus went up the mountain and sat down there with his disciples.  Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.  When he looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, Jesus said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?”  He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.  Philip answered him, “Six months’ wages would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little.”  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,  “There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what are they among so many people?”  Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down, about five thousand in all.  Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.  When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, “Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing may be lost.”  So they gathered them up, and from the fragments of the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten, they filled twelve baskets.  When the people saw the sign that he had done, they began to say, “This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world.”</p> <p>When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p>
