<h3 class="date">March 11, 2025</h3>
<h3 class="title">Tuesday In The Week Of 1 Lent</h3>


<div class="citation">1 John 1:8-9</div>
<blockquote class="opening-sentence">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, but if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</blockquote>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of Almighty God our heavenly Father, to set forth his praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and on behalf of others, those things that are necessary for our life and our salvation. And so that we may prepare ourselves in heart and mind to worship him, let us kneel in silence, and with penitent and obedient hearts confess our sins, that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.
</p>

 <p>When the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God thrusts them out before you, do not say to yourself, “It is because of my righteousness that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has brought me in to occupy this land”; it is rather because of the wickedness of these nations that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> is dispossessing them before you.  It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to occupy their land; but because of the wickedness of these nations the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is dispossessing them before you, in order to fulfill the promise that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made on oath to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p> <p>Know, then, that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is not giving you this good land to occupy because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.  Remember and do not forget how you provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God to wrath in the wilderness; you have been rebellious against the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> from the day you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place.</p> <p>Even at Horeb you provoked the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> to wrath, and the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.  When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.  And the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets written with the finger of God; on them were all the words that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken to you at the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly.  At the end of forty days and forty nights the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.  Then the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> said to me, “Get up, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have been quick to turn from the way that I commanded them; they have cast an image for themselves.”  </p>

 <h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3>
<p>The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.  Making a whip of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.  He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!”  His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”  The Jews then said to him, “What sign can you show us for doing this?”  Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”  The Jews then said, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”  But he was speaking of the temple of his body.  After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</p>
