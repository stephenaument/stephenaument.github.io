<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p>Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
</p>

<p>
Most merciful God,<br>
we confess that we have sinned against you<br>
in thought, word, and deed,<br>
by what we have done,<br>
and by what we have left undone.<br>
We have not loved you with our whole heart;<br>
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.<br>
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,<br>
have mercy on us and forgive us;<br>
that we may delight in your will,<br>
and walk in your ways,<br>
to the glory of your Name. Amen.
</p>

<p>
Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. Amen.

<div class="version-NRSVCE result-text-style-normal text-html">
 <p>Since you saw no form when the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire, take care and watch yourselves closely,  so that you do not act corruptly by making an idol for yourselves, in the form of any figure—the likeness of male or female,  the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air,  the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth.  And when you look up to the heavens and see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, do not be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has allotted to all the peoples everywhere under heaven.  But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> has taken you and brought you out of the iron-smelter, out of Egypt, to become a people of his very own possession, as you are now.</p> <p>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> was angry with me because of you, and he vowed that I should not cross the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is giving for your possession.  For I am going to die in this land without crossing over the Jordan, but you are going to cross over to take possession of that good land.  So be careful not to forget the covenant that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God made with you, and not to make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God has forbidden you.  For the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">Lord</span> your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</p>

 <h3>Concerning Fasting</h3>
<p>“And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.  But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,  so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</p> <h3>Concerning Treasures</h3>
<p>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal;  but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p> <h3>The Sound Eye</h3>
<p>“The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light;  but if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</p>

 <p class="indent">He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
 <p class="indent2">was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
 <p class="indent">He descended to the dead.</p>
 <p class="indent">On the third day he rose again.</p>
 <p class="indent">He ascended into heaven,</p>
 <p class="indent2">and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
 <p class="indent">He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
 <p class="indent">the holy catholic Church,</p>
 <p class="indent">the communion of saints,</p>

  Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>

for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
<br>
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
and by walking before you<br>
in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
