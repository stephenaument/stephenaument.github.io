## Exercism.io Walkthrough Screencast Series

I'm experimenting with a screencast series on YouTube walking through the [exercism.io](https://exercism.io) Ruby track.

Before I got to do a lot of pairing with other experienced devs I always wished I could watch more people just code. I didn't have a great sense of how other people went about their work or if my methods were weird or normal. This was especially true early on. It's one thing to follow a tutorial, but I just wanted to see somebody code.

I'm certainly not the first person to post exercism.io walkthroughs, but my assumption is that one more example of a working developer's workflow and thought process is a good thing.

I'm also trying to think of creative ways to coach my team more effectively. My schedule doesn't always allow large blocks of pairing, but I can find time to record and post a screencast. These videos will hopefully be useful for them.

My plan is to do handful of these and then promote them a bit to see if they are as helpful as I hope they will be. If you watch them and find them helpful, drop me a note or leave a comment.

UPDATE: I've packaged the first group of these into a FREE video email course that I'm calling, [_10 Days of Tactical Ruby With Exercism.io_](/10dotr/). [Go here to enroll.](/10dotr/)
